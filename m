It is doubtful such a tool would do per binding type checking given 
types are global and we've avoided making types per binding so far.

If this was a problem, then it probably would have been fixed already 
because it generates a warning. An I2C device probably isn't all that 
coupled to SoC power states, so boolean is probably always going to be 
used here. But maybe not.

If we do any cleanup here, I think that should have exactly 1 location 
that reads this property instead of 77. Perhaps the driver core can just 
handle everything and drivers don't have to deal with it.

It's really outside the scope of a device binding what is used for 
wakeup-source as that depends on the platform. So I think just 
'wakeup-source: true' in device bindings is fine. I don't think we have 
to change all the existing cases either, but the patches are already 
written so I don't have an issue applying them.
