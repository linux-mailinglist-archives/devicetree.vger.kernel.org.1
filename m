There is no variant for atciic100. It's a dedicated I2C controller IP.

I made the mistake you mentioned above in v1. But after your review,
I know the compatibles in the bindings should be <soc/platform>-<device>.
Thus, I have removed "andestech,atciic100" in v2, and have used
"andestech,qilai-i2c" and "andestech,ae350-i2c" instead. Also, I have
removed all the occurrences of atciic100 in v2 to avoid the confusion.

v2: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-i2c/20260122-atciic100-v2-0-7559136d07cf@andestech.com/

The reason I mentioned the SPI series is I want to add "ae350-i2c" in
this binding, like "ae350-spi" in the SPI series. Again, could I keep the
compatible "ae350-i2c" as the fallback compatible in this binding? If
not, there will be only one compatible "andestech,qilai-i2c" in the
next version.

I apologize for the lack of detail, and thank you for your patience.

Thanks,
