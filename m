It's not ideal as the overlay should really not care about that, but it
will probably work around the warnings for this specific case. I'll have
a look.

Do you envision we will fix this problem in a nicer way in the future ?
I wonder if it would become part of the DT connector support (or
whatever becomes of that). I've heard multiple people telling me they
would like to revive the proposal (or see it revived), so maybe there's
hope. I know I have many copies of essentially the same overlays for the
same Raspberry Pi camera modules connected to different boards which I
would like to upstream.

I'll check that. Sorry for not noticiting it before.

This one is caused by an issue in imx8mp.dtsi. A patch has been posted,
see https://lore.kernel.org/all/2690282.X9hSmTKtgW@steina-w/. I think
Alexander would appreciate feedback :-)
