Would you like me to integrate that in my patchset or is it sufficiently 
decoupled that it should be handled separately ?

I was just looking though the initialization process, and I notice that 
pcie_failed_link_retrain() is called unconditionally and it LOOKS like 
it ought to be solving our problem. So I'm going to throw a bunch of 
logs in there and see what's going on, and whether it seems like we can 
safely piggyback on that for EcoNet, and I'll come back with a v9 which 
either switches to that, or else adds the pci_bus_sem and continues with 
the mtk_pcie_retrain solution.


Thanks,

Caleb
