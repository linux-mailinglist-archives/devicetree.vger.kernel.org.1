That's downstream driver for downstream IPA thermal governor, which is
different. As you can see there, there is a split of the total power
to 'static power' and 'dynamic power' and thus those 2 coefficients:
'static-coefficient' and 'dynamic-coefficient'. There is also
polynomial for the exponential curve approximating temperature impact
to the increasing leakage (static power).

This is totally not upstream code and quite complex to derive thus
fly upstream. Therefore, in upstream we have very simple power
model right now, but it will be possible to update it at runtime
when the leakage is increased. I hope the new v5 version that
I'm going to send, will get into mainline soon [1].

Lukasz
