I also have the NanoPC-T6 with one of the A3A444 eMMCs which suffers
from I/O errors in the default HS400 mode. These are its details in
/sys/block/mmcblk0/device/:
manfid: 0x0000d6
oemid: 0x0103
name: A3A444
fwrev: 0x1100000000000000
hwrev: 0x0
rev: 0x8

I wasn't sure if I was just unlucky to get a faulty chip, but seeing
this thread it seems like a wider issue. On my board, limiting it to
HS200 mode gets rid of the I/O errors, and it seems that lowering
the frequency to 150MHz also avoids I/O errors.

I did a quick unscientific test with fio; HS400 Enhanced Strobe mode
with a 150MHz clock gives slightly better performance than HS200:

HS200 mode:
read: IOPS=697, BW=43.6MiB/s
write: IOPS=697, BW=43.6MiB/s

HS400 mode with 150MHz clock:
read: IOPS=805, BW=50.3MiB/s
write: IOPS=799, BW=50.0MiB/s

so from my perspective, limiting the frequency would be a better fix
than disabling HS400 entirely.

It could also be of interest that the clock used apparently can't
provide an exact 200MHz, e.g. in HS200 mode:

root@t6:~# cat /sys/kernel/debug/mmc0/ios
clock:		200000000 Hz
actual clock:	187500000 Hz
vdd:		18 (3.0 ~ 3.1 V)
bus mode:	2 (push-pull)
chip select:	0 (don't care)
power mode:	2 (on)
bus width:	3 (8 bits)
timing spec:	9 (mmc HS200)
signal voltage:	1 (1.80 V)
driver type:	0 (driver type B)
