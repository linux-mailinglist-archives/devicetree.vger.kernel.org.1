Yes, that sounds good to me, thanks!

Don't sweat it, if that's working, it's fine. If it's not entirely
accurate, we can fix that later.

I saw in your git tree you kept the max at 5.126V. I think it would make
more sense to put 5.2V there, since this is the typical accepted high
voltage for VBUS, as issued by many power supplies, for instance. Also it
somewhat detaches that entry from the limitations of the AXP, and more
states what we *want*.
It wouldn't immediately make a difference anyways, since the kernel will
see that the voltage already programmed (5.126V) is within range, and will
just keep it.

Cheers,
Andre
