I don't get what you mean with "simple unit address based arithmetic
after sorting".

Also I don't get whether you are suggesting

A is as fragile as B, so you could equally well do B

or

A is as fragile as B, forget both of them.


I could imagine that you think that we want to create aliases in the
bootloader, but we don't want to do this.

We are suggesting that the (upstream-, Linux-) dtsi files get an
optional additional set of aliases named "mmc0", mmc1",...

In the bootloader we would read the boot source instance from SoC
registers and look up the alias "mmc%d", boot_source_instance
to get the node corresponding to a boot source.
