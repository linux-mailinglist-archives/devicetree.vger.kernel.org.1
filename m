It is enormous, but I don't think the intention was to finalize and
merge it all at once. I certainly don't intend to review it all now.
The final result looks sane to me and with that we have a good idea
what information needs to go in the DTB. I think the first step is to
define the new metadata tags and what DTB format changes are needed.

Fair enough.

What's similar is we need to define FOO is at offset X just like the
markers within dtc. We can add other types later, I'm just asking that
the design here for new tags and phandles accounts for that.

json has no concept of integer sizes (and numbers are floats). The
typical work-around for that is encode everything as a string and then
we're pretty much back to everything's a byte array. Pretty sure we've
been thru this already. So I don't know what format we'd use. I've not
come across one. Perhaps just DTS as that does have the type
information. :) In any case, I'm not interested in a revolution, just
evolution. I want a format that transparently works with only an
updated libfdt. Anything else is simply going to go nowhere (as
evident by the last 15 years of new DTB format discussions).

I know you aren't a fan of relying on .dts information for type
information, but that's not the only source anymore. We now have an
entire database of every last property and its type. That could be
what's used to populate type information. Again, we don't have to
define how we do it now, just allow for it (and any other metadata we
have yet to think about) in the DTB format changes.
