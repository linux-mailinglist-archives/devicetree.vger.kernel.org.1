A bit can be used for marking a tag as "safe to ignore if unknown".
I can reduce the bits 30..28 field.

bit 30:
 - 0b0: Do not ignore this tag if the tag id is unknown.
        If this tag id is unknown an error in the parsing should be reported.
 - 0b1: This tag can be safely ignore if its id is unknown. I that case the
        tag and its related data are simply skipped.

bits 29..28:
 - 0b00: No data
 - 0b01: tag followed by 1 cell (u32) data
 - 0b10: tag followed by 2 cells (2 x u32) data
 - 0b11: Tag is followed by a cell (u32) indicating the size of following
         data

Also, it is worth noting that the 0x0....... tag value family can still be
used.

Even if related to "old" tags, if a tag in this family is an unknwown tag,
the parser will report an error (at least because it doesn't know how to
skip the data part).

And so, next tag is always length + sizeof(padding). Next tag is aligned
on 32bits.

I would say that it depends on new (future) tags.

For instance, FDT_EXPORT_SYM, the tag used for exported symbols can be ignore
by the bootloader if it doesn't know about this tag.
Indeed, it doesn't need to understand and manipulate this tag. It just needs to
keep it in the dtb passed to the kernel.

Yes they will be documented as soon as they are introduced.

The generic tag value definition is the first step to have in docs to allow
the "skip if unknown" feature.
