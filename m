rds do have this property set already, but most don't. However, I am not 10=
0% certain (I have had a lot of SBCs, in my hands, but definitely not all o=
f them), so I added it for this board only. So do you think it should be ad=
ded for other boards too, or every user should add it for their SBC on thei=
r own?

Yes, I would like you to add this for the other arm64 boards, too.
I appreciate your concerns about not knowing, but we can help out here.
Maybe you can quickly go over the wiki and check each board's picture for
having a microSD slot, just to be on the safe side. But I am pretty sure
that full-size SD slots were only used on the first generation (A10)
boards, and any arm64 board always uses micro-SD slots. I would double
check this on my side during review.

If we would wait for individual board owners to submit patches, we would
wait forever. So thank you for spotting this, and sending a fix, but it
would reduce churn and improve the situation for everyone if you would
cover the other boards as well.

Thanks!
Andre
