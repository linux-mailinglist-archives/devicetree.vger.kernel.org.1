Because when the AP1302 is used with two sensors, it requires both of
them to be identical. The property could go to the sensor nodes, but it
would then be redundant, and would make it possible to write incorrect
DT. When designing APIs, one of my goals is to make them difficult to
use incorrectly, so I think the property is better placed here.

This being said, it won't cause lots of issues if we moved the property
to the sensor nodes. I think it's suboptimal with no benefit, but if
that's the only contention point, I can compromise :-)

Would that be a top-level compatible for the AP1302, or am I
misunderstanding something ? Or maybe a compatible = "onnn,ar0144-isp"
for the sensor node, not the AP1302 ? The AR0144 could be used with
other ISPs (I recently upstreamed support for the THP7312 external ISP
from THine for instance, which could work with the AR0144 from onsemi),
so the "compatible" property in the sensor node needs to be evaluated in
the context of its parent, not in isolation. I think that departs enough
from the compatible model to be better served by a different property,
instead of introducing usage of "compatible" with a semantics (both from
the point of view of the OS, and from the point of view of the DT
binding validator).

The AP1302 is typically used with a subset of the onsemi sensors in my
experience, so I indeed don't think we'll have scaling issues.
