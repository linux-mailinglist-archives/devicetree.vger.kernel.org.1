You have proven my point here. You were only able to model the GPIO
attached devices: buttons and LEDs. Nothing else of this cape was
modeled, nor could it be modeled with this solution.

Your example fails to do even the most fundamental task: the overlay
is still specific to just one host board. Go connect this cape to
an original PocketBeagle and try to apply the overlay to its DTS..

What you did with "export-symbols" in this example could have been
done exactly the same with normal overlays. These "examples" keep
showing "what" the "export-symbols" node does, not "why" it is
needed or better than just normal __symbols__.
