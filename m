boards do have this property set already, but most don't. However, I am not=
 100% certain (I have had a lot of SBCs, in my hands, but definitely not al=

> Do you mean all sunxi arm64? Or every arm64 board? Sunxi arm64 has like 5=
0 boards or so, that would be probably possible to do manually. If you mean=
 all arm64, that would be probably too much to handle at once.

Ah, no, sorry, just the sunxi ones, handling all arm64 boards would indeed
be quite an endeavour, and it's much harder to verify.
git grep counts 22 out of the 34 arm64 sunxi boards missing disable-wp, so
that sounds doable.

Many thanks,
Andre
