i2c: ma35d1: Add Nuvoton MA35D1 I2C driver support
   =20
This commit adds I2C support for the Nuvoton MA35D1 SoC. It provides
controller and target functionality, and supports standard, fast, and
fast-plus modes.

Does this fully restore the target mode configuration?  The reset asserts t=
he
hardware reset, which wipes the controller state, but it does not rewrite t=
he
target address register MA35_ADDR0.

Could this leave the device with a cleared target address, breaking target
functionality until it is manually re-registered?

Also, could this sleep during an active interrupt?  If this reset is called
and the device uses a shared IRQ, could an interrupt fire during the
usleep_range() while the device is in reset?  Because the lock is not taken
here, the IRQ handler might read from MA35_STATUS0 and trigger a bus fault.

Does passing 0 to ma35d1_i2c_stop() mask the error?  This increments
i2c->msg_idx and reports to the caller that the message was successfully
transferred, even though the target rejected the data byte.

Should this pass an error code like -EIO or -ENXIO instead?

Could this cause an infinite interrupt loop?  If I2C_M_IGNORE_NAK is set,
the switch breaks without clearing the interrupt flag MA35_CTL_SI or
advancing the state machine.

When the IRQ handler returns, the same unacknowledged hardware interrupt
will fire again immediately, potentially freezing the CPU.

Could this corrupt memory on 0-length read messages?  If a read message is
not the final message (!is_last_msg), it falls through to the else branch,
setting MA35_CTL_SI_AA to ACK an incoming byte.

For a 0-length message, this commands the hardware to receive a byte, which
triggers MA35_M_RECE_DATA_ACK.  The received byte will be written to
i2c->msg->buf[0], but the I2C core leaves buf as NULL for 0-length reads,
leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

Additionally, for a 1-length intermediate message, it would send an ACK
instead of a NACK for the final byte, holding SDA low and violating the I2C
protocol, which prevents a Repeated Start.

Is this hardware access safe when the device is runtime suspended?

The device requests the interrupt with IRQF_SHARED in probe.  If another
device on the same IRQ line triggers an interrupt while this I2C controller
is runtime suspended and its clock is gated, reading MA35_STATUS0 will cause
a bus fault.

Should this use pm_runtime_get_if_active() to verify the device is powered
before accessing registers?

Could a timeout lead to a use-after-free regression?

If wait_event_timeout() expires, no STOP condition was ever commanded, so
the MA35_CTL_STO bit is likely already 0.  This causes readl_poll_timeout()
to succeed instantly.

Because err is 0, ma35d1_i2c_reset() is bypassed, leaving the controller
active and interrupts enabled.  The function returns without an error code
like -ETIMEDOUT, and the caller frees the msgs buffer.

If the hardware later completes the operation or asserts a delayed interrup=
t,
i2c_ma35d1_irq_controller_trx() will dereference the freed i2c->msg pointer.

Can this access the controller while the clock is disabled?

ma35d1_i2c_enable_irq() writes to the MA35_CTL0 register.  By calling it
before pm_runtime_resume_and_get(), the register write happens while the
device may still be runtime suspended with its clock gated off, resulting
in a bus fault.

Could this race with an active target interrupt?  The i2c->target pointer
is set to NULL without acquiring i2c->lock.

If a target interrupt is firing concurrently, i2c_slave_event() could
dereference the NULL pointer.

Does this incorrectly treat a successful put as an error?

According to PM subsystem rules, pm_runtime_put_sync() returns 1 when the
device is already suspended.  This is a success case, but checking if (ret)
will spuriously log an error.  Should this be if (ret < 0)?

Does this successfully detect probe errors?  Since i2c->irq is declared
as an unsigned int, the check if (i2c->irq < 0) will always be false.

A negative error code from platform_get_irq() would be cast to a positive
unsigned value, masking the failure here and deferring it until
devm_request_irq() fails later.

[ ... ]
> +rpm_put:
> +	pm_runtime_put_noidle(dev);
> +	return ret;
> +}

Does this leave the clock permanently enabled on probe failure?

Because pm_runtime_resume_and_get() was called earlier, using
pm_runtime_put_noidle() drops the usage count without allowing the device
to enter the runtime suspended state.  When devres cleans up the PM runtime
context, the peripheral clock will remain enabled.

Are these register accesses safe if the device is already runtime suspended?

The ma35d1_i2c_suspend() and ma35d1_i2c_resume() functions unconditionally
access the wakeup registers (MA35_WKCTL, MA35_WKSTS).  If the device was
already runtime suspended before system sleep, its clock is gated off,
and these register accesses will cause a synchronous bus fault.

Does this safely handle mid-flight interrupts?  Since the interrupt is
registered with IRQF_SHARED, disabling the clock without first calling
synchronize_irq() risks a crash if an IRQ handler is still executing or
about to execute on another CPU when the clock is gated off.
