Done, thanks. Have also not increased the DCDC1 voltage to 1.16v for 1.5GHz as it's not yet working (and technically out of spec for the SoC) but will relook at the vendor BSP once this set is merged.

Done, thanks.

Will pull this out separately, as you say its only required for the joysticks on the -H.

This makes more sense with that explanation, thanks. Taking a while to get my head round how the power distribution is done in the embedded space.

Will do some more work on this and try and figure it out. The USB and second SD are not working well currently, probably this is why.

D'oh! Had to google PLL, should have googled this too.

Makes sense, will dig into the vendor BSP.

In hindsight this is taken from the vendor BSP, so I think is correct but will do some testing.

Thanks, will get the correct voltages. It turns out ALDO3/4 are both needed, but CPUSLDO is not. Will try and figure out what they are supplying.

Thanks again for the review! Will post up a v3 after some more thought about the regulators.
