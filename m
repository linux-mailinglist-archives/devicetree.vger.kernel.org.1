That's an interesting approach and I like it.

I am not sure though how the platform specific value could be composed.

The easiest way would be if it maps to some register values. This works
well when there's a bitfield with only a few bits which specifies the
bootsource, but not so when there are many bits. On TI AM62x for example
we have 4 bits specifying the primary bootsource, 3 bits specifying the
backup bootsource and 1 bit specifying if we are booting from the
primary or from the backup bootsource. This means we have an array with
potentially 256 entries with many holes and many different values
pointing to the same bootsource. We could reduce the number of array
entries by specifying a mask for each value. I am worried also that the
initial contributor might for example forget about the backup bootsource
and only upstreams primary bootsource, so we would have to modify
existing values for the primary bootsource when adding the backup
bootsource.

How about only adding the phandles to bootsource-map, like

bootsource-map = <&mmc0>, <&mmc2>, <&spi0>, ...;

New entries must then only be added at the end, existing entries must
never be changed.

But anyway, as with your approach the bootsource would become just
another driver specific binding SoC contributors would be free to choose
whatever suits best for them.
