Yep, especially when everything in the soc documentation _and_ the
board schematics calls i2c4 controller, clocks and data lines ... i2c4-foo.

I do agree that unnumbered controllers (like sdhci, sdmmc, sdio on
recent Rockchip SoCs) should be the responsibility of the boards,
but really don't get the idea of repeating the ever same list of aliases
in each and every board dts.

additionally, one would never ever point "serial3" or "i2c4" to anything
else than the uart3 and i2c4 controllers, because that would be completely
confuse everybody.

Like when the board uses i2c0 and i2c4, those should still have the
aliases i2c0 and i2c4, because when you have "i2c1" as alias for the i2c4
controller on the running system, so many heads will explode ;-)
