Sounds good.

Done as mentioned.

I'm easy, the order there seemed logical based on the physical layout on the -Plus but I don't have a real preference.

Will await your work on this, I'm not at all familiar with USB to this depth, conceptually makes sense though. This will also rely on the boost working well, which is at least now being enabled with the WIP AXP717 driver.

Nice, have reworked the SD and Wifi regulators as described, and power management for the Wifi in particular seems to be working much better after moving it off BLDO2 (which seems to be VCC-PLL) to CLDO4.

Thanks, makes sense. I've tentatively renamed CLDO3 to VCC-IO, looking at the H616 datasheet.

Swapped in CLDO4 for MMC2 and the card read fine, will swap it back and see what happens.

OK, shall I remove them or will it do no harm?

I don't think so, this was Andre's first suggestion when he sent the AXP717's kernel driver so have stuck with it, but either should be fine.

Ta, will see if I can find anything out.

Quite! That's the spec from the H616 datasheet, I may need to push it up to 1.16v max to hit 1.5Ghz, but will relook at it once the cpufreq patches land.

Thanks, I think I did know that from somewhere. My reading of the datasheet is 0.81-0.99v though, so will put those in.

Have called this VCC-IO for now.

Great, have added these in. From the vendor DT looks like the audio codec is powered from the G pin bank.

No worries, thanks for the feedback! Much improved now, I think the last big issue here is the USB ports. Have been testing on my -H for now, but will have to look at the -Plus too given the single port.
