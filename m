To me that is exactly what a fallback compatible is promising - if we have
any kernel / driver that supports the part that we are saying is a valid
fallback then we are saying we support at least the functionality of that
part (sure there may be extra stuff that doesn't work)

We had a long discussion a few years back on whether code that did

	if (read_reg_whoami() != EXPECTED_ID)
		return -ENODEV;

was correct. Someone (maybe Rob?) strongly argued that we must not
do that because it effectively made fallbacks pointless as we always
needed to upgrade the driver. I argued against this (on basis that
swapping in incompatible parts is annoyingly common) but was eventually
persuaded.

If that is not a valid reading of what fallback compatibles mean, is
there any documentation of the rules I can refer to?

This is where we disagree.

This is not hard to support, it just means not using generic compatibles
when the device differ (and they are not self describing which these are
not).
