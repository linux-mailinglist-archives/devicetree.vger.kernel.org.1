Hans,

I've been looking through the v4l2/vbuf2 code to get an idea of the
details for implementing a new memory type for secure buffers.  What
it comes down to essentially is that it would behave just like
V4L2_MEMORY_DMABUF, but then there would be an extra check in
__prepare_dmabuf (in videobuf2-core.c) when the memory type is SECURE
to ensure that it is actually from a secure dma-buf allocation.  So
I'm thinking an alternate solution might be cleaner so we don't have
two memory types that are handled nearly identically in most of the
code. What do you think about a new memory flag like
V4L2_MEMORY_FLAG_SECURE?  This would be set in vb2_queue struct like
the other existing memory flag. Then when it gets into
__prepare_dmabuf and invokes attach_dmabuf on each buffer...that call
could then check for the existence of that flag, and if it's there it
could validate it is actually secure memory.  Then in various other
dmabuf vb2_mem_ops (maybe alloc, get_userptr, vaddr and mmap) those
could also check for the secure flag, and if present return an
error/null.  Then also in the driver specific vb2_ops for queue_setup,
the MTK driver could recognize the flag there and then configure
itself for secure mode.

How does that sound as an overall strategy?

Cheers,
Jeff
