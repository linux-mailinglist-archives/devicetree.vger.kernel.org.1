Yes. Channel 0 is clockevent and channel 1 is a clocksource and sync
reference for channel 0 disable timing. 

32 bit counters seems like implementation choice rather than limitation
but that would need to be implemented and tested. Would you suggest to
extend it to 56 bit in the following patch?

I have boards with A733, A527, T113-S3, H616, H6, H3 and I
think some older stuff too. My motivation is mostly fun and learning.
I also use those boards in custom projects.

I will take up GPADC on A527 after finishing this as I worked with ADC's
a lot on MCU's. Unless other suggestions?

Thank you for comments.
