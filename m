Who can perform this mapping ?

The user applying the addon if a tool is used such as fdtaddon for instance
(even if this kind of mapping is not yet available in fdtaddon I proposed).

Or a driver that knows about the board connectors.

This driver will apply the addon dtb and provide custom mapping between
symbols expected by the addon (/import/) and symbols provided by the board.

A plugin need to know about all possible symbols available on the board
is applied too. This is the purpose of __symbols__. This just means that for
plugin all possible symbols are imported and symbol translation is not possible.

A plugin is designed for a specific base board. It needs to know about each
busses and how they are wired.

I mean a plugin references i2c5, the i2c controller number 5, and i2c5 needs
to be present in __symbols__.

The target property in __overlay__ identify the target node. Here also, this
is dependent on the board the plugin is applied to.

Addons depend only on the node, describing the connector, they are applied
to. They do not depend on the full specific board where this connector is
available.

Two different boards can have the same connector available and a given board
can have two connectors of the same family the addon can be connected to.

Best regards,
Hervé
