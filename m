Not sure if we mean the same when you say "store these values as alias".

What we want to do is a SoC dtsi providing something like:

/soc-aliases {
	mmc0 = &sdhci1;
	mmc1 = &sdhci2;
	mmc2 = &sdhci3;
};

With the mmc<X> numbers being the instance numbers from the reference
manual. We can then read the instance number from the SoC registers and
get the device node from that number by looking it up in the aliases.

We use this for example to load the kernel from the device barebox
itself has booted from.

Other examples include TI Omap/K3, AT91, Rockchip SoCs, STM32MP1.
