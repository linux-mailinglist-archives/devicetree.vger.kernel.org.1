The CSIPHY-to-CSID routing is runtime-configurable and is already 
managed by the media controller framework.

DT describes static hardware connections. The dynamic mux is a software 
concern, not a hardware description concern.

Yes but be pragmatic Neil. The first step in making the monolith into 
sub-nodes is the CSIPHY.

Once the CSIPHY is in, we can follow on with adding new nodes that way 
IPE, BPS, ICP, JPEG whatever and also work on implementing the old stuff 
in that new way.

We _won't_ I just don't support a big bang integration. Progressive 
changes over a longer timeline make the transition manageable, without 
accepting endless sub-standard stuff in the meantime or holding up all 
new SoC submission unless/until.

I mean there is a CAMSS meeting which I've been running for nearly a 
year now that both you and Vlad are invited to where we have been 
discussing this for months...

Anyway one conclusion of that is we want to transition to individual 
nodes for everything.

PHY is the first step which I'm taking because its easier for me as 
CAMSS maintainer to convince the CAMSS maintainer to take the relevant 
patches.

drivers/phy notwithstanding.

I freely admit to taking the initiative of phys = <> but Neil there is 
_no_change_ to the media graph and the "mux" is a runtime configuration 
that is one register in the CSID.

You seriously want a mux device in the kernel to model one bit in a 
register ?

No.

The long term plan is to do that. Discussed extensively with the Qcom 
teams delivering CAMSS, even invited community members along.

Here are the meeting notes - its all in the public domain
