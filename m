Yes, each of them has an (integer-only) divider between the PLL and
the respective mux. The problem though is that displays' EDIDs want
modes that are all over the place and don't seem to converge to any
common numbers generally (it looks like display manufacturers haven't
heard of VESA modes these days).

Following Heiko's nudge from the other sub-thread (thanks for the
pointers Heiko!), I derived the fractional PLL parameters for the
modes which couldn't be obtained cleanly from existing PLL values. It
ended up being 35(!) different rates for just the 7 displays my
colleagues and I could get our hands on, majority of which only
representable with the fractional delta-sigma component. That's after
consolidating the clocks which can be driven from the same
higher-frequency PLL configuration with small integer dividers. Seeing
all of that I couldn't help but think, "Surely those should be
possible to consolidate further by allowing for some error margin!" -
but had to guess again. Even a deviation as small as 0.2% of the
effective clock from the requested rate causes blank screens in my
sample - sometimes less than that.

This further leads me to believe that Brian's rate negotiation series
won't save me here, as the chances of two different displays at two
different weird modes magically agreeing on a PLL rate that is a
common multiple of their respective pixel clocks seem infinitesimal.
And their modes will most likely differ, as VP outputs are asymmetric.
Unless of course everything is 1920x1080@60 with a standard 148.5 MHz
pixel clock or its integer multiple - then the problem doesn't exist,
as this particular mode works even in the current configuration on all
VPs.

Thanks for the pointer! I've checked, and indeed it automatically
switches to the PHY clock for anything below 600 MHz.

This is in fact a notable improvement, because then only a handful of
higher-rate modes out of my modest sample need a dedicated PLL for the
VP0+HDMI setup: specifically, 3840x2160@160 (1478740 kHz),
3840x2160@144 (1275830 kHz), 3840x2160@119.88 (1186813 kHz - this one
might work with 1188000 if CCF allows returning higher-than-requested
effective rates) and 2560x1440@165.08 (645000 kHz).

3840x2160@120 can be driven from the current GPLL, as it's exactly 1188 MHz=
.

The configuration / policy to enable that transparently for the user
seems non-trivial though:
- If the output is HDMI and the display clock is <=3D600 MHz, always
source it from HDMI PHY (easy)
- Otherwise, if the display clock is 1188 MHz or its integer quotient,
always source it from GPLL, and disallow parent rate changes
- Otherwise, reparent to any active PLL whose current rate is an
integer multiple of the required display clock, and disallow parent
rate changes
- Otherwise, see if VPLL is free. If it is, reparent to it and request
its rate change to the required display clock (or its integer
multiple)
- Otherwise, tell the user the mode set failed (and let them retry
with a different mode, or own the pieces)

I'd love to learn if the above (or anything close) is representable in
the kernel, although I suspect it's not:
- Allowing or disallowing parent rate changes depends on the selected
parent here, while in the current clock implementation it's an
attribute of the child
- All PLLs are equal, but one (VPLL) is more equal than the others by
the virtue of being free more often, and also having the required
delta-sigma component
- Reparenting to an already running PLL if its rate permits should be
preferred to monopolizing the VPLL

Indeed. Changing the rate of a PLL while it's in use sounds scary,
even if a solution for the rate exists and can be found in reasonable
time.

I'd love to, but it seems that displays won't let me :-D

It might be helpful to pre-filter the allowed display modes to only
offer those which can be derived from the currently available PLL
frequencies. The problem is that it makes an extremely limited subset
on real-world displays.

Best regards,
Alexey
