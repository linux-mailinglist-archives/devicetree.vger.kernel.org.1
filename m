That's fine. Thanks for providing this and the raw data.

RSGMIIS, disabled, cleared by read of MAC_PHYIF_CONTROL_STATUS.

>      irq_gmac_5_n: 4047

LPIIS, enabled, cleared by read of LPI_CONTROL_STATUS which is done.

MDIOIS, disabled, clear on read of _this_ status register

>      irq_mtl0_n: 2244307

This will increment each time dwmac4_irq_mtl_status() is called for
channel 0, which will be called each time stmmac_common_interrupt() is
called. Thus, this indicates the total number of times the stmmac
interrupt handler has been called.

These should be cleared by reading the corresponding queue interrupt
control/status register, iow MTL_CHAN_INT_CTRL(). However, we do not
write to MTL_CHAN_INT_CTRL() to enable any of the interrupts there, so
this looks weird to me, so it would be an idea to look at what value
this MTL_CHAN_INT_CTRL() register contains, it may provide something
useful, but I actually suspect it's another red herring.

>      irq_chan0_n: 2244307

Similarly to irq_mtl0_n, this will increment each time
dwmac4_dma_interrupt() is called for channel 0, which will be via
stmmac_napi_check(), stmmac_dma_interrupt() and
stmmac_common_interrupt(). Therefore, it is expected to have the same
value as irq_mtl0_n.

Only interrupts 0, 6, 12, 14 and 15 are enabled. Status bits in this
register require '1' to be written to clear them. As the value written
back is the status that was read masked by the interrupt enable, if
bits 2 or 10 are set, they will never be cleared, so will increment
each and every time stmmac_common_interrupt() is called. Therefore,
these values are not significant.

These values are the sum of irq_mtl[0-4]_n, so would be expected given
the other numbers.

It's slightly interesting that irq_chanX_2_n and irq_chanX_10_n don't
match their corresponding irq_chanX_n values, which implies that they
have been clear. It's likely given that we're talking about 0, 2 or 3
times that's due to the first few packets and these bits hadn't been
set. So again, I don't think TBU and ETI are significant.

These counts suggest that the interrupt handler was entered 2548 times
at the point they were captured, which corresponds to "normal"
interrupts for channel 0.

So channel 0 responsible for 2672 normal interrupts. Again, this
reinforces that the other values with 2672 are likely not significant.

As you have several interrupt signals which presumably show up in
/proc/interrupts, do the values in your IRQ counters correspond with
those interrupt sources? Are any of these interrupts shared with
anything else?

Hmm, looking at 7.1.2, and the mention of "ENET QOS TSN LPI RX exit
Interrupt" I'm wondering whether Freescale have wired the lpi_intr_o
signal of the GMAC to their OR4 gate. This is the LPI RX exit
interrupt output, and it is cleared when reading the LPI control/
status register. However, its deassertion is synchronous to the RX
clock domain, so it will take time to clear.

The purpose of this signal is to trigger to external hardware (to the
GMAC) to restore the application clock to the MAC. I'm not sure that
this was meant to be wired to an actual CPU interrupt. The only clue
is the name which suggests it is, but there's nothing that states
there's a way to disable it being asserted which makes me more
suspicious that it's not meant to be a CPU interrupt.

So, maybe this is the cause of the interrupt storm. Maybe Kieran isn't
seeing the storm because his receive path is not entering LPI.

I think a useful check for this would be if you could either disable
LPI entry at the link partner, or hook it up to another system which
can have tx_lpi disabled, and see how the iMX8 system behaves.

If preventing the iMX8 receive path entering LPI fixes the problem,
then I think this is likely the culpret.

However, I'd be worred about this - if we "disable LPI" by way of
the advertisement at the local end, there is the possibility that a
remote system could override the negotiation and force its transmit
link into LPI mode, which would cause the iMX8MP receive side to see
LPI entry and exit, triggering this interrupt. If this is correct,
that gives an attacker a way to manipulate the iMX8MP system,
potentially causing all sorts of problems.

Hmm. Not sure I like this look of that.

If this hypothesis is correct, then yes, disabling EEE is the only
way forward for this, but I would suggest going further - ensuring
that SmartEEE is enabled on the PHY but with the advertisement
cleared (so EEE negotiation indicates not supported) to block the
receive side LPI getting to the EQOS.

This also means that 100M EEE would also be affected, so just
disabling 1G EEE in DT is insufficient.

Andrew - if we need to go down this path, I think we need a flag in
the PHY flags to indicate that we want SmartEEE enabled.
