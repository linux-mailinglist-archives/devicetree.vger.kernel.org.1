We had a 'hack' in the HDL where we tied the CS pins to activate them at
the same time, but since we are aiming to handle each device indually it
would be nice to at least enable all CS defined in the devicetree. It is
strange that we can define up to 8 CS for one device, but the spi-engine
only selects the first one.

Since last week I have been testing  the approach you and jonathan suggested,
handling the multiple device support within the driver and using the multiple
data lane. Additionally, I have included the ancillary device to manage
the devices individually when required (and to make it easier to write
and read using regmap), but some other problems came up:

* When addressing the devices/channels individually, I would like to
select only the respective SDI lane on each transfer, but with the 
ancillary interface there's no way to define a rx lane mapping.

e.g: If we want to read a register from the device 2 (index 1), the
ideal scenario is to activate only the SDI1, so the controller writes
the right value into the read buffer. Without this mapping, we get
the trash from the lane SDI0.

can we add some new parameter to set the rx/tx lane mapping in the
devm_spi_new_ancillary_device()?

* This driver registers a regulator and a GPIO provider associated with
the main SPI device. Can we register them for each ancillary device too
or this is not allowed? I am still confused on how to handle this kind
of situation.

Yeah, since the DRDYs are reduced to one pin in the controller, this is
not an issue for now. What concerns me more are the PGA and GPIO provider,
since each device has it own pins.

For now, only two drivers have this requirement.
