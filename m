I like the idea of subchannels to create logical tree-structures. It opens
up for other possibilities.

I wonder if the varying channel index would still confuse a user, even
with this metadata attribute, like:
- out_altvoltage0
- out_altvoltage1
	- out_altvoltage1_subcomponent_of = out_altvoltage0

would there be a different way to name the full_postfix in
__iio_device_attr_init() that would allow to keep channel index the same
(e.g. altvoltage0 for multiple internal sub-channel) and still be
compatible with userspace tools? I don't know, something like:
- out_altvoltage0
- out_altvoltage0_0
- out_altvoltage0_1
- out_altvoltage0_2

userspace tools would understand out_altvoltage0_0_frequency as:
- direction: out
- type: altvoltage
- channel idx: 0
- attr name: 0_frequency

and that would be a problem?
