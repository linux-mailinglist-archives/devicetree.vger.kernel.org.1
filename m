Oh, sure, I'm obviously going to add both SerDes interfaces which support
various interface modes as phylink_pcs instances in a follow-up series.
I was planning to do basic bridge offloading and FDB access first, then
SerDes PCS, then LAG, then VLAN, and then last but not least using the
802.1Q-based special tag (LoC of just that feature is almost as much
as all the rest together in the vendor driver).

Using an 802.1Q-based special tag is advantageous in some situations,
for example PPE offloading engines typically do support 802.1Q and
802.1ad VLANs, but do not support any special tag apart from those
of the same vendor (eg. MediaTek's PPE supports MediaTek's 4-byte
special tag, but includes "plain" 802.1Q or 802.1ad/Q-in-Q as part of
the tuple identifying a flow). Hence by implementing an 802.1Q-based
tag one can benefit from better performance, less CPU load and less
energy consumption when combining these switches with router SoCs
of other vendors if they implementing "picky" offloading fast-paths.

No. The 802.1Q-based tagger is basically implemented entirely by
setting up additional bridges, virtual bridge ports and special VLAN
forwarding rules. It takes more than just "switching" the tag protocol...
But hence it can be implemented in pretty much any way we want.

It's just an oddity of the management firmware which runs on the switch.
Port ID 0 has special meaning, physical ports are counted started from 1.
For example, when adding FDB entries, port_id == 0 means not specifying a
port (eg. for filter rules). However, it *is* weird that BIT(0) of any
portmap isn't ever used in the driver, and it looks like it could be like
you describe below. I will ask.

This construct could never the less help to make things more easy and
less annoying to deal with. I might just start counting from reg = <1>
in DT and have a dummy/reserved port 0.

Always having add/substract 1 is often confusing because then you have
to remember if a port number or mask stored in some structure or
variable denotes the DSA perspective or the switch firmware perspective.
Unifying the two would definitely be beneficial. I can give that a short
tomorrow.
