Hi Jessica,

Thank you for your review.

We agree on the concept. It should either be "arm,rainier" or "arm,morello-r0p1"
if we want to capture the information of SMBIOS. When we reach consensus I will
update the patches accordingly (Please have a look at my reply to Rob).

The name morello on its own is too overloaded of meaning if we do not specify to
what we are referring to.

I still did not start bringing up to speed the DTS for FVP but I think that we
should distinguish in between SDP and FVP since not everything is the same,
hence it should have something similar to:

	compatible = "arm,morello-fvp", "arm,morello";

Will do.
