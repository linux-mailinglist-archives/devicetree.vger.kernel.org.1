Why is this outside the sensor node?

Please don't hijack the graph binding (ports and port nodes).

Why not a new compatible (e.g. onnn,ar0144-isp)? Seems to me there would 
be at least some overlap. If there are supplies, then the names should 
be the same, right?

If you really want onnn,model, then that's fine. Probably there's not 
enough different sensors for me to really care...
