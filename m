May I also suggest having some sort of IIO_VOLTAGE_DIAGNOSTIC channel
type? Would that be worth the trouble?

We could also maybe just drop burn-out current completely from
dt-bindings and add IIO_CHAN_INFO_BURNOUT_CURRENT. Given that this
feature is only used ocasionally for diagnostic purposes (I assume...).
