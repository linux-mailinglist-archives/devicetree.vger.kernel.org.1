This is not compatible with the PHY bindings if you don't have a defined MUX device in the middle, it's wrong. You're hiding the muxing details in the CAMSS blob node.

DT must describe the possible interconnections between the nodes, if a PHY can be used by multiple hardware components, it must be described.

I am, and I agree it's fine to do it step by step.

I agree on the approach, I never said otherwise, but you need to have the big picture in mind.

When you'll have the CSID subnodes, where will you add the phys properties ? you'll keep them in the CAMSS top node ? add all CSIPHY to all CSID nodes ? this is wrong and this needs to be fixed now.

As I said I agree on the progressive approach, not the PHY DT bindins approach.

Honestly I don't care about the userspace media graph, this is a software problem and we can totally make the transition seamless if we want.

Don't limit the DT hardware description because of a software userspace ABI breakage, this approach is not the right one.

Why not ? We have drivers that even toggles even single bit to solve those kind of situations.

Physically they're a mux to route the CSIPHY to the consumers, it's a fact... even if it's a register or a single bit.
