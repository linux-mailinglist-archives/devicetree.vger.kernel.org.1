Hi Vladimir,

thank you for the elaborate and very helpful review (one could even say
"inspiring" ;).

See some questions and answers inline below.

This documentation was probably meant for a whole series of different
chips which are used with the (proprietary) switch driver which in case
of the MxL862xx is running on the internal microcontroller rather than
on the host OS...

I'll remove the comment, PRX300 is a xPON SoC which contains the same
switch IP. There are plans to upstream support also for this SoC, but of
course without the proprietary switch driver which this API refers to.

Yes.

We can't. This "rule" anyway seems to rather be just a software
convention, see below.

Absolutely true. It works coincidental because only SerDes port 0
(port_id 9) is allowed to be CPU port. When using SerDes port 1
(port_id 13) as a user port it already starts to be tricky and more care
needs to be taken when setting up CTP port assignment...

Now that I understand more of what it actually does I'll try to come up
with something smarter.

The number of available CTP (32) limits the possible setup for CPU ports.
The reference driver only allows port_id 9 (SerDes 0) to be used as CPU
port. SerDes 1 may also be used as CPU port in theory.

Understood. On old kernel, lets assume with this basic driver just added
but future DT with more than one CPU port described one should still end
up with the first CPU port used and all ports assigned to that CPU port.
Right?

Testing turned out it doesn't matter and it's totally fine to have
the CPU port enabled/disabled by calling mxl862xx_port_enable() just
like for any other port.

Good you are asking this. It's another oddity which came from the vendor
driver. It's wrong in many ways, see below.

This is probably because the SerDes ports also support 10G QXGMII PHYs
with 4x 2.5G TP ports connected via a single pair of 10G SerDes lanes.
In this case 4 port indexes are used for the 4 ports.

My understanding of the internal port IDs by now:
	 MxL86282				MxL86252
port 0:  microcontroller			microcontroller
port 1:  PHY port 0				PHY port 0
port 2:  PHY port 1				PHY port 1
port 3:  PHY port 2				PHY port 2
port 4:  PHY port 3				PHY port 3
port 5:  PHY port 4				PHY port 4
port 6:  PHY port 5				n/c
port 7:  PHY port 6				n/c
port 8:  PHY port 7				n/c
port 9:  SerDes PCS 0				SerDes PCS 0
port 10: SerDes PCS 0 (QXGMII)			SerDes PCS 0 (QXGMII)
port 11: SerDes PCS 0 (QXGMII)			SerDes PCS 0 (QXGMII)
port 12: SerDes PCS 0 (QXGMII)			SerDes PCS 0 (QXGMII)
port 13: SerDes PCS 1				SerDes PCS 1
port 14: SerDes PCS 1 (QXGMII)			SerDes PCS 1 (QXGMII)
port 15: SerDes PCS 1 (QXGMII)			SerDes PCS 1 (QXGMII)
port 16: SerDes PCS 1 (QXGMII)			SerDes PCS 1 (QXGMII)

MaxLinear seems to tell board designers to always use port 9 as CPU port
and port 13 for an SFP cage or for an additional single-port PHY.
But this seem to be limitations of their current downstream driver
implementation and the hardware would be capable of using either
or both SerDes port as CPU port, and also support connecting a QXGMII PHY
to end up with 12 TP ports in total.

Port 0 indeed turned out to be the microcontroller, I can confirm that
because it screams when poking it with IEEE1588v2 packets, which you
get to see in the kernel logs:
net eth1: Invalid source port, packet dropped, tag: 88 c3 0f 04 00 00 00 10
                                                                         ^^
                                          IGP/EGP is 0 here, Record-ID is 1

The datasheet says that Record-ID "[...] is used for logging information
for PTP and OAM packets".

And calling mxl862xx_port_disable() on it makes it shut up...
