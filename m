But "what" should be put inside the partition is part of the input
argument, not the output. You said (maybe I got this wrong) that the
schema would apply to the output of binman. If you want to let user
know what's inside, maybe it is worth adding a label, but otherwise I
don't like the idea of a compatible for that, which for me would mean:
"here is how to handle that specific portion of the flash/here is how
the flash is organized".

Maybe I fail to see why you would want these description to be
introduced here, if they are not useful to the OS.
