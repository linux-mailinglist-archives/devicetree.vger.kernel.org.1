I think the wording in the binding can be understood two ways.

The binding says the following about the default-state property:

"""
       The initial state of the LED. If the LED is already on or off and the
       default-state property is set the to same value, then no glitch 
should be
       produced where the LED momentarily turns off (or on). The "keep" 
setting
       will keep the LED at whatever its current state is, without 
producing a
       glitch.
"""

I think the issue here is around the meaning of "initial state". I 
believe Naoki is probably thinking about the **HW** initial state of the 
LED, which is whatever is the state of the LED without SW control. I 
think Diederik is thinking about this being the state of the LED right 
when the SW takes over and configures the LED before the trigger is setup.

In the first interpretation, there's no need for an "improvement" for 
the patches as they would just fix correctness of the DT wrt HW state at 
boot.

In the second interpretation, a change of this value must be justified 
as people will simply disagree forever and we could end up with people 
reverting other people's patches after each release. If it's just a 
matter of taste, I believe the typical answer is keeping the status quo.

We should find a way to make this binding not up to interpretation.

Additionally, if the LED cannot be controlled on some boards, I don't 
think it should be part of the DT.

My understanding is Naoki wants to use default-state = on, for the 
bootloader to turn it on as soon as it takes over control of the LEDs.

The solution may still involve configuring the Device Tree, and we're 
trying to have U-Boot-specific changes to the Device Tree in U-Boot 
source tree to a minimum.

They do however share most of their Device Tree (for Rockchip at least) 
and the least (ideally no) changes we can have in U-Boot the better.

Device Tree is not kernel specific as you said already.

It shouldn't, but (most of) the Device Tree is shared, so you cannot 
just dismiss U-Boot behavior when talking about Linux behavior based on 
Device Tree interpretation. We may have a need for a bootloader-specific 
property. We have a Linux-specific one after all 
(linux,default-trigger). Though... that does seem to be on the edge of 
what the DT is made for (description of the HW, not logic/policy).

Barebox also uses upstream DT as far as I know and supports some Radxa 
products (Rock 5B/5T/..., CM3, Rock (RK3188), Rock 3A from the 
arch/arm/boards/radxa-* directories). Zephyr has support for RK3568, 
RK3588, and other SoCs, and uses upstream DT as well.

Again, we're talking about modifications of the Device Tree here, so 
typically I would expect all consumers of that DT to be interpreting the 
properties the same way, except if you have OS-specific properties/nodes 
(think u-boot,config-compatible nodes, linux, prefixed properties, 
bootph- properties, ...).

If the *HW* default state of the LED is off and the default-state 
property is off, then you won't be able to tell apart a completely 
bricked board and one that is stuck somewhere between U-Boot proper and 
the Linux kernel taking over that LED.

The status property defaults to okay, and we do not want them to be 
listed explicitly. Not sure if there's consensus on applying this to all 
properties which have defaults, across all subsystems.

The lack of a property doesn't necessarily mean it was forgotten, agreed.

Agreed.
