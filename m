Actually, that's a good point.  We can do this more simply: the new
ranges with defined lengths are only used for ignorable tags.  If we
need to add new tags which aren't safe to ignore, they go in the 0x0
range, like the existing tags.

Exactly.  Or to make it clearer that we don't need any additional
information, next tag is at ALIGN_UP(length, FDT_TAG_SIZE).  We
already do something like this with with FDT_BEGIN_NODE tags - we
ignore bytes to realign after the node name string.

Ow, that's when it gets complicated.  Whether a tag is safely
ignorable depends on what the consumer is doing with it.  Fixups and
exports can be safely ignored by something just passing it through.
However reference fixups *can't* be safely ignored by something that
will consult phandles, because they might not be correct until the
fixups are applied.
