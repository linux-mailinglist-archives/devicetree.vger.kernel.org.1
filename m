Well, yes, I would assume we want as long an overflow period as 
possible. The tricky/interesting part is that the interface is still 
32-bit MMIO reads, so we need to find out how the consistency works. The 
manual recommends to read LO first, but not sure that means its latching 
HI upon the LO read. Otherwise we should read HI, LO, and HI again and 
compare both HI's. Probably needs some testing.

That's great, and what I was hoping for! ;-)
Feel free to reach out on IRC if you have any questions or comments.

Yes, LRADC and GPADC are good devices to start with. Also crypto comes 
to mind, the most useful there being the TRNG device, which helps the 
kernel to start its own RNG much quicker. Chances are those things are 
close to the existing SoCs, so there might be not too much to do here.

Cheers,
Andre
