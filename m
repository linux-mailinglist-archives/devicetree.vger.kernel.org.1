I don't think we have any choice, but to remove the tags.

We should be able to distinguish between node and property tags at
least. Either by value or location. IOW, node tags must follow a
BEGIN_NODE tag and property tags must follow a property.

You answered that below. :)

> Should we simply remove all unknown tags when a modification is done?

For that node or property, yes. For the whole DTB, no. Though does
modifying a property constitute modifying a node?

Perhaps we should separate the 'version we can read' and the 'version
we can write'. Let's say it is v18 that allows unknown tags, but v19
that actually adds any specific tags (or adds tags that are not safe
to ignore). Then a DTB with last_compat_version=3Dv18 and version=3Dv19
can be read by libfdt supporting v18+, but requires v19 libfdt to
write it. We'd still have to allow writing a v19 DTB with v18 libfdt,
but we'd have to downgrade the version to v18 (or downgrade if we had
to drop some tags).

The DT and bootloader/firmware are typically bundled together and in
that case there shouldn't be an issue of different versions. You can
have a newer DTB instead of the firmware one, but that doesn't need to
have the new tags (if the OS does require them, then it broke
compatibility).

Even with this series, I think everything can be ignored if you are
only looking for compatibility with what we have now. It's only if you
want to support the addons, then you need v?? which defines the set of
tags for addons. So I'm not certain a tag bit is the right way to say
safe to ignore or not. I think if we have a new tag that every client
has to understand and handle, then that's a major version change. I
think the original intent with the versions was 0x10 (aka 16) was a
new major version, 0x13(v18) would be another minor rev, and 0x20
would be the next major version.
