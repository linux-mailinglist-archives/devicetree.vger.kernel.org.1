Something along those lines might work. I'd not thought about the case
of one 'internal' going to multiple 'external'.  Otherwise I was wondering
if something informal related to labels would work.  We've done that where
we've been associating things like voltage and power measurement from a sin=
gle
pin.  It's rather adhoc though.  Possibly we could roll it into a newer
more general scheme.

If the association is done as meta data attributes alongside existing
channels then as you say existing tools will kind of work, just need some
human understanding of what is actually being controlled until they catch
up with the newer schemes.

Lots of ways we could actually represent the graphs.  Going to take some
figuring out!
