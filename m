I've made some analysis on [3] on this bug, but it was based solely on
u-boot. I was having trouble with the regulator and on u-boot nothing
would trigger the GPIO PD6 and the vcc-gmac-3v3 regulator, so the NIC
was completely dead. Next I did an analysis based on [2] because the
u-boot PHY initialization was flaky.

As I mentioned, PHY initialization is flaky on u-boot, so maybe that
assumption is correct.

If I recall correctly (I don't know if I kept it in my notes :c), that
could be the case. regulator-boot-on makes the NIC work (LEDs blink, at
least) but it doesn't get initialized.

I do. It's available on [4]

Adding [5] for reference here, thanks! Will check it out.
