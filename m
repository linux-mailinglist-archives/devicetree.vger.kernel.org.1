True. To (partly) avoid that, I've dropped the line that discards
disabled bits in dwmac4_irq_status():

 	/* Discard disabled bits */
-	intr_status &= intr_enable;

to ensure that all bits are processed and cleared. I then didn't see any
high count of any of the GMAC_INT_STATUS interrupts. For
MTL_INTERRUPT_STATUS it's a bit different, as by default only one queue
is processed.

That's why I tried to enable all 5 queues in DT, but alas, it didn't
help. I'll try again and count all possible interrupts.

I agree that it seems really weird. And why this would be related to
cpuidle and EEE is also a mystery.

More help would certainly be welcome. And I really appreciate your
support Russell.

While I would like to merge a workaround and move on, I also understand
your position, having had the exact same stance in other kernel areas
and pushing for problems to be fixed correctly instead of worked around.
The only argument I have to defend the workaround approach is that I'm
putting a lot of hours trying to do the right things in other
subsystems, and I can hardly scale that to networking. It's not a great
argument though.
