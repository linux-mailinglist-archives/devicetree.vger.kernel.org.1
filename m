OpenWrt firmware upgrading tool (sysupgrade) refers "compatible" string 
to validate new firmware file is surely "for this board".

currently both Pi E dts have "radxa,rockpi-e", it makes flashing wrong 
firmware (include bootloaer, U-Boot) possible.

Radxa ROCK Pi E v1.x(DDR3) and ROCK Pi E v3(DDR4) are different 
incompatible boards, it must have different "compatible" string.
