v5.15 DTS user of this binding is still valid user. Why would you break
it?

Not really relevant to my question. I understand that this is not
maintained, but I asked about backwards compatibility.

Backwards compatibility of the ABI means that existing in-tree and ALL
out-of-tree users of given ABI must keep working fine. Properties with
lists have strictly defined order, so changing that order is considered
ABI break, unless you prove otherwise.

Calling code unmantained is not proving that ABI is not broken.

OK, yet I do not understand "driver is only used for internally". How
Maxlinear engineer can know all projects around the world and all 7
billion people if they use that ABI? And if they are right and no one
uses it outside of Maxlinear, then let's drop this code. It's dead code,
no?

Krzysztof
