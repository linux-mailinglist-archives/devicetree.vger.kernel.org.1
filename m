I don't like scanned-by, even for a tool that would always get the
same results like checkpatch. For LLM, this is even worse, as two runs
may give different results for the same code.

IMO what makes much more sense is to add information there when
a change was done due avoid a problem detected by sashiko, and what
was the fixed issue, e.g. a textual description like:

	Changed locking schema after Sashiko's report report about
	XXX race condition.

Also, except if 100% of the=20

Adding a link makes sense to me. It doesn't need to be to the
sashiko's email though: it can be to the entire thread.

If the entire content of a Sashiko review is ignored, I don't think
it is worth adding anything. Just like we do with humans, IMO the
best is to just mention what changed due to some feedback received
by a human or by a bot, mentioning who/what bot helped to identify
the issue.
