Just a nitpick, but on a round smartwatch this approach will give you
a $width =C3=97 0px famebuffer ;D

Yeah, I was talking about curves in general. Your proposal is on the
low-complexity side thankfully.

Well, different people will have different standards and what might be
good enough for some will annoy others. I'm not saying that we need to
be perfect at all cost, but if there's a relatively easy way to cut down
on inconsistency, it might be worth taking.

Additionally, having a very clear-cut quality indicator could remove a
whole class of bikeshedding options. (speaking of the devil xD)


The problem I have with curves is, the more 'correct' you make them, the
more convoluted they become. Like take for example the corners. Rounded
corners are circular right? But what if someone makes them 'squircular'?
Well, they are usually quite small anyway so maybe it will work out.

But then what about a smartwatch with big, squircle-shaped display? Bam,
now you need to complicate how corners are handled.

But also: are rounded coners typically circular? Just now I've thrown a
OnePlus 6 (thank you so much for the great mainline support btw!) onto a
flatbed scanner. While a circle fits decently well there it's not really
a perfect fit, so maybe they went with a different curve after all.

That being said, imperfection isn't my main issue with curves. It's all
the non-discreteness they bring to the table. As in, you now need to care
about approximations, rounding, imprecise measurements and so on.

Frankly, I don't see any significant cost here. It's very easy to gather
and rather easy to process.

Let me think about it=E2=80=A6 The most common operations I see people actu=
ally
doing with this data would be:

* letterboxing =E2=80=93 easy with both curves and masks
* ensuring padding | margins for icons on the screen =E2=80=93 with curves =
you
  can use a formula, but won't it be easier to just count pixels anyway?
* routing a spline along the border =E2=80=93 like if you want to have some
  periodic pattern drawn there, it's probably a bit easier to do with
  curves
* drawing something at a constant distance from the border =E2=80=93 with c=
urves
  you can again use exact formulas. But isn't that an overkill really?
  I'd think most people will go for something like a morphological
  dilation instead

What could the curve information be needed for though?
The more I think about it, the less value I see in it really. Like, if
you're adjusting the screen contents, pixels _are_ the smallest unit you
need to concern yourself with. The only thing that comes up to my mind
is if you were to animate the cutout shape somewhere else, zoomed in.
And thats already a quite contrived scenario.

Is there actually any use case that instead of ending up with pixels
either way, would be better served by a (possibly inaccurate) curve?
(future me here: that spline-along-the-border from earlier I guess)
