Apologize for the delay! I needed to think a bit more carefully about
how to suggest moving this forward.

My conclusion is that we need to extend the PM domain infrastructure
(genpd in particular), to allow drivers to dynamically inform whether
it's okay to turn on/off the PM domain in runtime.

There is a similar thing already available, which is to use dev PM qos
along with the genpd governor, but that would not work in this case
because it may prevent runtime suspend for the device in question too.
I have therefore cooked a patch for genpd, see below. I think you can
fold it into your next version of the series. See also additional
suggestions below the patch.

Subject: [PATCH] pmdomain: core: Introduce dev_pm_genpd_rpm_always_on()

For some usecases a consumer driver requires its device to remain power-on
from the PM domain perspective during runtime. Using dev PM qos along with
the genpd governors, doesn't work for this case as would potentially
prevent the device from being runtime suspended too.

To support these usecases, let's introduce dev_pm_genpd_rpm_always_on() to
allow consumers drivers to dynamically control the behaviour in genpd for a
device that is attached to it.

Furthermore, I believe the way forward could be like this:

*) The arm smc call to inform the FW whether it's okay to turn off (or
not turn off) the PM domain for the UFS controller really belongs in
the genpd provider. More precisely, from the corresponding genpd's
->power_on() callback, we should send the smc call that prevents
power-off and in the ->power_off() callback we should send the smc
call that allows power-off again. No matter of what the spm|rpm_level
is set to. If you think caching of the state is important, I suggest
looking into that as an improvement on top.

*) In the UFS controller driver, we should call the new
dev_pm_genpd_rpm_always_on() to control whether the PM domain should
remain on during runtime or is allowed to be turned off.

*) In the system suspend callback, based on the spm|rpm_level (I guess
only one of those levels is really needed?), we may call
device_awake_path(). This can prevent genpd from turning off the PM
domain during system suspend in those cases when that is needed. See
genpd_finish_suspend() more details. Also note that, the genpd in
question also needs the GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP bit set for it, if
not already.

Kind regards
Uffe
