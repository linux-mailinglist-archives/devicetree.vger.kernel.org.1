It's platform specific, so however it wants and not my problem.

It's a map, not an array so there should be no holes. The entry index
is not significant. In this example, the platform just defines the
cell as:

<primary_or_sec:16><sec_source:15:8><primary_source:7:0>

You could fit it all in 8-bits, but I spaced it out in case the next
SoC needs another bit.

A mask value would be okay until you have 2 different registers and
then you need a variable number of cells. And then I could imagine
someone will want to define the register address for each cell in the
name of a 'generic binding'. That's not what I want to see.

That would work too. Then you just have the index to register value
lookup in code. Doesn't matter to me too much. The only downside I see
is having to enforce that people don't try to insert entries in the
middle.
