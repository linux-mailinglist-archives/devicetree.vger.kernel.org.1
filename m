Why do I need to? That's used for some tool and has nothing to do with a 
device's DTB. However, I thought somewhere in this discussion you showed 
it under a flash device node. Then I care because then it overlaps with 
what we already have for partitions. If I misunderstood that, then just 
put your schema with your tool. Only users of the tool should care about 
the tool's schema.

IIRC, that's a different type where partition locations are stored in 
the flash, so we don't need location and size in DT.

Yes for subnodes, and we already have some somewhat standard ones for 
"u-boot" and "u-boot-env". Though historically, "label" was used. 

Top-level, meaning the root of the DT? That sound like just something 
for the tool, so I don't care, but it doesn't belong in the DTB.

Me too.
