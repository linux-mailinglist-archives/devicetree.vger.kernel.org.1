greping other platforms there are a bunch 0xf000 offset 8KB mapped:

  amd/amd-seattle-soc.dtsi
  arm/corstone1000.dtsi
  arm/foundation-v8-gicv3.dtsi
  arm/juno-base.dtsi
  mediatek/mt8516.dtsi

but, looking at the stm32mp25 memory map (1) page 239:

0x4AC22000 - 0x4AC3FFFF 120 Reserved -
0x4AC20000 - 0x4AC21FFF 8   GICC

I can know guess that the "Reserved" 120kB is for aliasing the 64kB 
blocks. Thus describing the GICC 128KB range size makes sense

similarly 4KB + 120KB Reserved for GICH and 8KB + 120KB Reserved for GICV

there might be a misunderstanding, I was referring to my dropped quirk 
that I now dropped, not your options
