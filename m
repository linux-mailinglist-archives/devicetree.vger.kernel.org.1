You're probably right. I see the problem here.

The problem is mostly too few people working on genericizing
the pinctrl code I think, it makes me be happy about any such
attempts. But I should pay more attention, clearly I just looked
at it superficially.

pinctrl_generic_dt_node_parse_config() or so? Is it vague enough?
