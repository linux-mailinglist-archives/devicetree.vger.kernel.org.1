If you only want your code being used in Linux, then stick with
"GPL-2.0".  If you want your code to be able to be copied into other
GPLv3 licensed code bodies (like Hurd and others), then license it as
"GPL-2.0-or-later".  Your call.

You already own the copyright by virtue of creating the code (you can't
give it away), so might as well put your mark on it to make it more
noticable.  But it's not required, if you don't want to, no one can
force you, again, your call.

Hah, I like that hack.  But why not just use PORT_UNKNOWN?
