Yeah, I think that works.

I don't especially like this.  phandles do have a bearing on types.
But as I said to Rob, I think they're a sufficiently special case,
that I'd prefer not to handle them as just an aspect of a more general
"types" system.

Btw, since we're looking at dtb changes anyway, one possibility would
be to no longer encode a node's phandle as a property, but include it
as a new field in the FDT_BEGIN_NODE tag.  Putting it in a property
was always a bit of a hack - in traditional OF, it was generally the
node's address in memory, not something from a property.  Doing it
that way might side step some messy edge cases like dealing with
improperly encoded "linux,phandle" properties.

I don't really understand how they would be used for plugins - I
thought the idea was that addons would more or less obsolete plugins.

"the dtb" being a single addon, yes?  That could have several meanings
in the base tree depending on where the addon is attached, yes?
