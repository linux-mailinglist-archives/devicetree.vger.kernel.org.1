No, the point of my patch is just to correctly respect #cells and 
hopefully discourage any further abuse of Linux's current behaviour. The 
fact that Linux interprets multiple mappings for the same input ID as a 
set of equivalent choices to pick one of, rather than a set that must 
all be maintained in parallel, is an orthogonal concern. Again there's 
not necessarily one right answer there.

Eww, if the intent of that was to bake further abuse into DT ABI to 
bodge around Linux behaviour then I double-NAK it even harder :)

My initial thought would be to either add an index argument so that 
callers can keep count and request the Nth match if they want to - like 
we do in various resource management APIs, for instance - or go all the 
way and convert the existing target and id_out complexity into 
usage-specific callbacks too.

Not sure whether to be impressed or disgusted... If we are to take a 
callback approach then it should probably standardise on passing a full 
of_phandle_args to encode the map output. Particularly given what I've 
just noticed below...

Oh dear, I totally overlooked this, and off the top of my head I'm not 
sure it's simple to fix :(

So it's still not actually working as intended. Oh well, I did say it 
was untested...

Thanks,
Robin.
