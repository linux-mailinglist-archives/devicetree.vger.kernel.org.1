Would there actually be 4 DRDY inputs on the host system? I assume that
they would be the SPI offload trigger. But there can only be one trigger.
So I would expect all DRDY going into an N-input AND gate and the output
of that gate used as the trigger.

For this type of SPI controller where it can read multiple data
channels at the same time, the .dts should look like this:

spi {
    #address-cells = <1>;
    #size-cells = <0>;

    adc@0 {
	compatible = "adi,adaq7768-1";
	reg = <0>, <1>, <2>, <3>;
        
        spi-rx-bus-width = <1>, <1>, <1>, <1>;

	/* other properties */
    };
};

The reg property is the 4 CS lines and spi-rx-bus-width having 4 items means
that the controller has four SDI lines (the value <1> could be different if
each data channel/device was dual or quad SPI).

This goes along with what jic23 suggested about making it similar to
what we do with daisy-chaining.

The only tricky part with that is when devices don't share all of the
same of another property. For example, in the wiring diagram above, I
see that the DRDY lines are not connected together. But I would assume
that everything else is the same (all chips share the same power supplies,
etc.).

We would need to modify devicetree bindings a bit in cases where a property
needed a per-chip value. But I think that this happens rarely enough, that we
can just do that on an as-needed basis rather than trying to make every property
support multi-device use.
