Because the multi-CS stuff for SPI flash memory was added later
and broke it. There is only one obscure user, so it is not entirely
surprising if no one noticed yet.

I'm not sure the SPI mem work ever actually got finished. In the code, see:

	if ((of_property_present(nc, "parallel-memories")) &&
	    (!(ctlr->flags & SPI_CONTROLLER_MULTI_CS))) {
		dev_err(&ctlr->dev, "SPI controller doesn't support multi CS\n");
		return -EINVAL;
	}

But there is no SPI controller that has that flag. So I'm not sure if
anyone is actually using this yet. And anyway I think the aim there was
to be able to assert two CS at the same time, which is not what we are
aiming to do here.

And the other potential user of multi-cs is stacked-memories, but this
is only mentioned in dt-bindings docs and nowhere else.

There doesn't seem to be any other code besides the validation that is
done when the SPI device is added that makes use of more than one CS line.

I would like to agree with you that there should be a better way, but I
still don't see an obvious way to do it if there is one (other than the
suggestion I already gave that probe should somehow give you two spi
devices instead of one).
