That's what manufacturers do on a very frequent basis.  They tweak something
that has no affect on the interface or channel scaling etc and release a new part
with a different ID.  Can be something like a part suited to different operating
conditions, or with a different supply tolerance.

They won't remove the ID, but they will put other values in it to
indicate new revisions of a part - often entirely backwards compatible
- sometimes with extra features that we don't use until the driver is updated.

We've had this discussion a number of times for whether an ID register difference
alone makes a device non compatible, and the answer from DT review has always been
a firm no and that it is incorrect to reject an unknown ID if the dt-compatible
is known.  The compromise that people were happy with was an info print if
such a mismatch is detected as it might indicate an incompatible part replacement
and a broken DT.

Probably 80%+ of IIO bindings with fallback compatibles do not have
matching "who am I" register values.  This is incredibly common.

Yes, it's a part in the family. Each of the compatibles here has a
separate datasheet:

https://sensirion.com/media/documents/C4F8D965/66F56F53/LQ_DS_SLF3S-0600F_Datasheet.pdf
https://sensirion.com/media/documents/6971528D/63625D22/Sensirion_Datasheet_SLF3S-1300F.pdf
etc

(wonderfully inconsistent file naming ;)

Would be lovely if true. Sadly almost never true. They are typically just
the next number in a list of parts released. There is no direct information
on feature set encoded in that value, we have to have a look up table in
the driver to translate to feature set. (Not relevant here but sometimes
manufacturers forget to change the number and we get different feature
sets with the same ID and no discoverability)

If they were an OR of features that would be great.

The thing is a little structured in this case

0x07         Liquid flow sensor
0x  03       Product family (e.g. SLF3x)
0x    03     Subtype (e.g. SLF3S-0600F)
0x      02   Revision number (changes with minor firmware or hardware revisions)

But both the product family and subtype are numbers to feed into look up tables
(maybe revision number as well)
