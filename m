I think this is a useful tool in the effort to build a complete addon-board
solution. But I'm still missing how it all fits together, do you have a real
working overlay making use of this somewhere I could take a look at? Maybe
an overlay for one of the addon-boards you list below (one of the BeagleCapes
for instance).
