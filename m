Please note, RTL8211E PHY do use undocumented SmartEEE mode by default.
It ignores RGMII LPI opcodes and doing own thing. It can be confirmed by
monitoring RGMII TX and MDI lines with oscilloscope and changing
tx-timer configurations. I also confirmed this information from other
source. To disable SmartEEE and use plain MAC based mode, NDA documentation
is needed.
