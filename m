Maybe use an example with more stuff changing? Do we want same excitation
for burn out? I've no idea.

=46rom a very initial look, maybe do something similar to the folk have
been looking at for the more complex DDS devices where we have lots
of channels that are on the same 'wires'.  Basically add a numbering
scheme to keep them reasonably separate - channel numbers are cheap.
Maybe first channel is 10->1f, second 20-2f etc.  They are differential
so it will get ugly.  Perhaps have a play around and see if there is
a reasonable channel naming scheme for this 'same inputs, different thing
being measured case'

I'm not yet sure I'm convinced that a separate channel model makes sense.
Even less in the DT given these are different settings for one channel.
That doesn't mean we don't split them up in the driver if channels
are the best implementation / ABI to userspace.

Basically nothing actually says diff-channels numbers match the
userspace ABI, so break that link.

This is again a bit similar to the DDS case, but there we have more than
one on at a time (as controlling different parts of the signal - freq
/ phase / amplitude).  Here we at least avoid that complexity.

I didn't really like that solution but we didn't come up with any other
way to support the complex stuff going on.  Hence I'm not necessarily
suggesting to go that way here.

I think this may be a case of laying out different options in an ABI
doc then reviewing that to make sure we spot corner cases etc.

Thanks,

Jonathan

p.s. Sometimes it feels like the world just keeps getting more complex!
