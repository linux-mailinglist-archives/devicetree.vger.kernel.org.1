I've spent an hour studying the pack_fields() API and it's (well
written) documentation. The only example of it's use in the current
kernel I could find is the Intel E800 (ICE) driver. And there it does
make sense as it is handling conversion between CPU and hardware formats
in the hotpath for DMA descriptors, a total of 3 different structs, each
with their individual accessor functions.

Using this approach for this switch driver would require writing a lot
of boilerplate code, accessor functions for each and every struct,
and a struct definition once unpacked for the host platform and then
again using the PACKED_FIELD(...) notation for the hardware format.
Surely, most of that could be auto-generated using the existing
vendor drivers API definition. Yet (at least to me) it feels like
over-engineering and also it would require rewriting most of the driver
which has been discussed for almost 2 months now.

Also note that the driver doesn't need the naturally aligned version of
all these structs in native CPU endian -- they are not used for further
processing anything, you can see that because they aren't ever used as a
function parameters, but only ever as exchange formats when
communicating with the firmware.

Maybe I'm missing something obvious here and there is a more simple way
to use this API, some generic macros using compiler introspection to
magically handle everything without needing to write packed and unpacked
struct definitions and individual pack/unpack boiler-plate functions for
each struct. If so, please provide me with an example or explain how you
imagine the pack_fields() API to be used in the context of this driver
and it's total of at more than 30 different structs which will be used
for all the different firmware function I will need to use in order to
implement phylink_pcs as well as the various offloading and VLAN-related
functionality the driver should have in the end (ie. the structs you
currently see in the mxl862xx-api.h file are just a fraction of what I
hope to add there by follow-up series)
