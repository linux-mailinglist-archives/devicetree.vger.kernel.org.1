Thanks for clearly describing this difference.

This is something I considered and in the end I found no reason to use
256 x 192000/176400 as it would use higher clocks than needed (or
equal, at 192 and 176.4 kHz), deviating from the common practice and
probably consuming a little more power, all apparently without any
gains. And, last but not least, without a motivation in the docs I have
available.

Of course, should there be known reasons to keep the 256 x
192000/176400 frequencies, I'd be fine with changing my patch.

You have a good point. I just checked the git history and indeed these
four clocks have never been mentioned by any of the device trees in
mainline.

However removal of parts of bindings is normally never supposed to
happen for backward compatibility.

@DT maintainers: would removal of optional clocks from bindings allowed
in this specific case?
Quick facts:
* bindings introduced in 2021, with the 4 optional clocks from the
  beginning, no changes afterwards
* none of the optional clocks ever appeared in arch/.../*.dts
* the 4 optional clocks actually describe a part of the clock topology,
  so their presence in I2S bindings is debatable at least
* the I2S controller described by the bindings does not need the
  4 optional clocks to work properly if the clocks are used correctly,
  as this patch proves

If this looks like a good idea, I can send a patch to remove those
optional clocks. Otherwise I can send one to add a comment to
discourage people from using them.

Best regards,
Luca
