From: Quentin Schulz <quentin.schulz@cherry.de>

The Pre-ICT tester adapter connects to RK3588 Jaguar SBC through its
proprietary Mezzanine connector.

It exposes a PCIe Gen2 1x M.2 connector and two proprietary camera
connectors. Support for the latter will come once the rest of the camera
stack is supported.

Additionally, the adapter loops some GPIOs together as well as route
some GPIOs to power rails.

This adapter is used for manufacturing RK3588 Jaguar to be able to test
the Mezzanine connector is properly soldered.
