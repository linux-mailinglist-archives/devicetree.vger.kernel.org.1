>>> So currently, the "USB Offload Playback Capable Card" kcontrol (on the USB card) will determine if there is an offload path.  However, this differs than what Amadeusz is suggesting, in that he wants a single kcontrol created for EACH USB card identified (per USB audio device), and a simple enable/disable control to determine if the offload path is enabled for that card/pcm stream.

> Yes, this is the suggestion.  One writeable kcontrol on the USB SND audio device that will control if that USB audio device is going to be offloaded.  If the kcontrol reads back "enabled" (or 1) then userspace knows that the offload path is active.  Else, if it reads "disabled" (or 0) after the attempt to set the kcontrol, then the offload path was unsuccessfully enabled, ie maybe due to no available offload streams.

It's a bit over-engineered IMHO.

My alternate suggestion is a read-only control reporting that offload is
possible. Then userspace attempts to open a PCM device on the ASoC card,
any failures due to resources would be handled at that point.

It's very hard to follow, I don't understand what userspace needs to
'control' - in the modify sense. What userspace needs is a place to read
from, and then select the PCM device and follow usual ALSA configuration
with hw_params.

>>> Expanding on Amadeusz's suggestion, my idea is to have an enable/disable kcontrol per USB stream.  For example, one USB card could have multiple PCM devices (USB streams).  So we would have something like:
>>>
>>> PCM Offload Playback Enable Stream#0  enable/disable
>>>
>>> PCM Offload Playback Enable Stream#1  enable/disable
>>>
>>> ....
>> are those read-only or not?

The writable part introduces a complicated error handling, e.g. what
happens if you have an offloaded stream and then this control is changed
with amixer while streaming?

>>> So we'd know which USB card and PCM device is selected for USB SND.  However, I see what you're getting at in case there are multiple supported streams, because userspace needs to know which ASoC card/pcm combination corresponds to which USB device/combination.

>>> To summarize, if we did this, I'd plan to remove all the kcontrols in ASoC card, and have the following in the USB card for an USB audio device that supports one USB stream:

> OK, so now to just figuring out something that both you and Amadeusz can agree on before I put time implementing it.  So I've implemented the "enable/disable" path that Amadeusz suggested, which is highlighted in my previous response, for evaluation purposes.  The overall question is which layer should control the devices that will be offloaded.  In my submissions up until now, the control was given to the ASoC platform card to determine which USB device to offload.  Amadeusz mentioned that it might be beneficial to move the control to the USB SND devices, because what if the offloading is NOT backed by ASoC. (highlighted in [1])  However, IMO the current implementation assumes there is ASoC involved, which should mean that there is some platform "card" that is backing the offload path.  Please let me know if my understanding is incorrect, @Amadeusz. 

I still fundamentally don't get why userspace would try and modify any
controls, this makes the flows more complicated IMHO since you also have
the PCM open/hw_params stages.
I really think it'd be more than enough if the USB card exposed
read-only values showing that offload is possible and which card/device
to map to. Then userspace uses the ASoC PCM device and errors are
handled at that level.
