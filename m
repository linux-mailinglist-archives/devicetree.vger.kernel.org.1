This just shouldn't be there as a generic property for all AHCI
controllers, if there are controllers that have such a supply it should
be part of the controller specific bindings not forced on every single
controller.

Right, and also even within the board this is a property of the target
device not the controller.  Arguably you could say that your separate
ATX supply ends up being part of the same system for practical purposes
but it's a stretch.

Yeah, same here.  This is a property of the PHY, and possibly of a
specific PHY.

The underlying issue here being that the generic AHCI code's bindings
and hence regulator usage just don't reflect general AHCI hardware at
all, that's then causing knock on effects since as you say there's no
way for systems to provide sensible information corresponding to what
the drivers are asking for. =20

I agree that we should do something here, I was working on the basis
that the bindings reflected the hardware but that seems rather far from
reality.  I'm wondering if we should have an API that lets drivers say
they're requesting a regulator for a "legacy" binding, that way we can
keep all the checking of usage and avoid fragility with mishandling of
errors but avoid complaining at users.

I see.  That's sounding like rather than having something that applies
to all SFP devices anything we do end up having should be something that
represents a SFP cage specifically, that's the thing that has the
physical specification with a known set of supplies.  With soldered down
stuff I suspect there's enough room for complication that it should be
dealt with on a device by device basis if needed.

I guess even if they're not controlled separately it's possible that
someone might decide that having two LDOs is part of their filtering
strategy...  It is generally easier to cope with the situation where one
supply does two consumers that are controlled together than it is to
deal with the situation where two supplies that are normally the same
are delivered by two separate regulators.  It all feels very edge casey
thugh.

It sounds from the cover letter for this series like there's some demand
for power control of SFP cages, the cover letter isn't terribly specific
about what circumstances though.  Possibly there's some UI for this on
the system, or the hardware has some mechanism for detecting physical
insertion to the SFP cage (hopefully well in advance of the electrical
contacts being made)?  Romain, are you able to share more specifics on
the use case here?
