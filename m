The channel configuration is indeed very similar for the three chips.
All three have IDAC, BOC and VREF configurations.

Do you have a proposal of how such an abstraction would look like? I do
like the idea of abstracting the firmware parsing, scales and shared
calculations.

This is the same approach I took around the BOC, it feels kinda hacky
but it makes sense. Just an idea I thought about just now: What if we
have an additional write-only "_enable" sysfs attribute for these
channels?

The approach I took for the IDAC was to have a single configuration that
it's enabled for all channels. This makes some sense in my device when
thinking about optimal software sequencial reads, because of the
register layout, but I also see the value in having per-channel IDAC
configuration. I think I will take your approach, so we have the same
channel configuration around this.

Have you thought about how to implement the BOC? In the ADS1262 the
feature can be found "Sensor Bias". What I did was add per channel DT
properties for this too.

Another question. When you implement power management in the future,
will you enable autosuspend? IDAC currents will be lost if autosuspend
is enabled. Is this acceptable? In my case I did enable autosuspend, but
I have some doubts about this.
