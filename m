Right. See below, but I think a bootloader would need to know how
important a mismatched minor-rev or sub-rev is. I guess we could come
up with a rule and hope it works for everyone, though...

This _only_ covers SoC with the goal of getting the SoC out of the
top-level compatible string. The SoC tends to be a lot easier to deal
with. It doesn't try to solve the board problem. I was hoping to bite
off something small that we could agree upon and I'm worried that if
we try to tackle the board problem at the same time we'll just get
deadlocked.

IMO different families of boards will have different ways of
identifying different SKUs or boards with different 2nd source
components. Thus, IMO, for describing that type of thing we need to
allow different "loaders" to specify different types of properties.
...but I guess this is controversial and folks would like to identify
some sort of "universal" system that everyone can agree upon. While
that seems like it could be doable for SoC, I don't see it working for
boards. Maybe I'm just wrongheaded.

Aside from helping to deal with boards / second sources, what is missing?

If we're _just_ worrying about the SoC, I think we don't need to do
any string parsing. In the case of Qualcomm, I'd imagine that you'd
have _just one_ "soc-family-compatible" for all Qualcomm SoCs. Perhaps
"qcom,msm". This is because I believe all Qualcomm chips have a global
"product ID". So for "sdm845", you'd have:

soc-family-compatible =3D "qcom,msm";
soc-product-id =3D <0xSDM845_PRODUCT_ID>;
soc-product-variant =3D <0xIF_THERE_ARE_SKUS_OF_SDM845_PUT_HERE>;
soc-product-description =3D "Qualcomm SDM845";
soc-major-rev =3D <...>;
soc-minor-rev =3D <...>;
soc-sub-rev =3D <...>;

So no string matching. The bootloader would have to have knowledge of
whether it would pick a device tree where a sub-rev, minor-rev,
major-rev, or variant doesn't quite match.

With that explanation, does it sound better? ...or maybe it's just not
useful to you because moving the SoC out of the compatible isn't
useful to you without also handling the different SKUs and second
source components?
