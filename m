Ah. I've been reading too many drivers. For some reason I thought this
had more intensity channels. My comment clearly garbage as you point out.
I maybe got thrown by how ALS sensors used to work.  They used IR only
and a clear window that covered both IR and the frequencies we need for
illumiance measurement. The light channel was then some combination of
the two. I guess they've figured out how to filter that IR out of that
these days.  That leaves me a little curious as to what applications actually
use the IR channel.

Yes, that one was correct.

Agreed on this analysis. From a readability point of view it is nice
to have balanced calls but as long as we only underflow / get clamped
in a path where we never increment again that's fine.  I'd add a comment
somewhere to say that's intentional.

This one I'm more dubious on.  Basically you are saying on remove we happen
to have an extra decrement for largely unrelated reasons so we are fine.
That to me smells fragile even if it works.  For instance someone tidying
up the imbalance in scenario 1 (which would seem reasonable to do from
a code understandability point of view) would break scenario 2.
I'd rather we had something explicit for this. Probably an devm action
that just checks for events being enabled at exit and disables them as part of
the tear down.

So not bugs as such, but fragile which is not good from maintainability
point of view.
