Indeed the sole user of the entire 
IOMMU_RESV_SW_MSI/iommu_dma_get_msi_cookie() mechanism is that one place 
in vfio_iommu_type1. iommu-dma itself treats MSIs just like any other 
DMA mapping, so if address space limitations are not correctly described 
then any breakage will be to DMA in general.

+1 to that - the arbitrary fake MSI reserved region was only ever meant 
to be a first step to get existing VMMs working with bare minimal 
"squint and pretend it's like x86" changes; MSI_IOVA_BASE was literally 
just picked to fit the standard Qemu virt machine memory map nicely. It 
was always intended that we'd eventually have more 
Arm-system-architecture-aware VMMs that would understand it's just a 
notional hole that needs punching in VFIO address space _somewhere_, and 
we'd figure out some interface for negotiating it. There has also always 
been at least one platform where this MSI_IOVA_BASE knowingly could 
never work, but that one (Arm Juno) also has sufficient other 
impediments to realistic VFIO usage (I've had it working, but it's 
definitely no more than a novelty) that it was never going to justify 
any upstream investment itself.

If we do now have a "serious" VFIO-capable system where the basic bodge 
no longer suffices, that surely does justify it finally being time to do 
the right thing.

Thanks,
Robin.
