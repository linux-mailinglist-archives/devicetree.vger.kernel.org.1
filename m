RPi ISP is named 'raspberrypi,pispbe' in RPi downstream drivers. See
linux/drivers/media/platform/raspberrypi/pisp_be/ in RPi tree.

Thanks for those references.

I know nothing about Tesla FSD SoC internals I'm afraid. But it seems
plausible to
me that you would not goto the expense of designing your own SoC if something
existed off the shelf you could just buy.

I suspect the original SoC series for Tesla, Tensor etc tend to look
very "exynos"
centric as it is the non differentiating bits of IP, but also the IP
that is required first
to bring up the platform.

I agree that was the correct decision IMO, and it is a very similar
situation here
as far as I'm concerned. Most people don't know Tensor G1 SoC as Exynos
9845.

There is more Google IP than TPU but I see the point you're making.

Or multiple big pieces of IP.

Does having it all under the exynos directory help you somehow with
maintenance? Has having Alim maintain tesla-fsd in a separate directory
caused issues?

I structured it like this as I thought it would scale better, and also
because it was
consistent with what you had accepted previously for other Exynos derived SoCs
like Tesla.

Sorry about that. I can add Alim and others to CC next time around. I didn't
notice he was listed as a reviewer of Exynos. I thought it was only for Tesla
FSD SoC. My apologies Alim!

Thanks,

Peter.
