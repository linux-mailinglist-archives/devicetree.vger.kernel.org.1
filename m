Right, in that case it does make sense to use a realtek prefix, since
the software and mcu solution is all theirs.

Reading this, it feels like you "should" have compatibles that uniquely
identify the protocol used. Looking at the devices below, it seems like it
would be possible to use compatibles based on the switches themselves, e.g.
zyxel,xs1930-pse etc. If there are other devices that use the same
protocol, they could fall back to the ones below.

It'd be good to have the net developers weigh in though, as to whether
using compatibles based on the switches is suitable.
