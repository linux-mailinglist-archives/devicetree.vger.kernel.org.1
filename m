Yes, the main issue I see is the enumeration by PRP0001 instead of by ACPI
_HID. Also note, whatever ACPI has supported in _CRS (resources) should be
used that way (memory, interrupts, DMA channels, etc).

Technically there is no issue with that, indeed.

I think Rob is correct. But what's the problem to describe IRQ natively in _CRS
in ACPI via Interrupt() or GpioInt() resource? You mean there is no actual wire
connection to it?

On ACPI the clock are usually managed by firmware, but in new specification
we also have ClockInput() resource. I dunno if there is still a gap between
ACPICA and CCF to integrate that.
