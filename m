I am not sure if I get this point. This device has a single IIO_LIGHT
channel, and the scale only applies to it. Are info_mask_separate and
info_mask_shared_by_type not the same in that case? I have seen that
some drivers use both info_mask_separate for INFO_RAW, and
info_mask_shared_by_type for INFO_INT_TIME and/or INFO_SCALE, but that
could make more sense if there were multiple channels of the same type.
What am I missing here?

On the other hand, the integration time applies to both the IIO_LIGHT
and IIO_INTENSITY channels, so I guess you are suggesting to add it
to both channels as info_mask_shared_by_type because the timestamp
is a channel itself. Moving it form shared_by_all to shared_by_type is
alright, and I will add it to V5.

You are right assuming that the datasheet will not give us an answer
about that. I suspect by my measurements that the measurement is carried
out with the first integration time, which would make this issue
harmless. But as I am not 100% sure, I contacted the manufacturer to
have a reliable answer. I will wait for a few days while I fix all the
stuff for V5, and if I don't get an answer, or the new integration time
is used, I will use the mutexes as you suggested. I don't like using
mutexes to protect sections of code "just in case" without a real reason
behind, but if there is no way to know, then it will have to be that
way...

I took some time to audit this in detail, because although my
expectations are that atomic_add_unless(usage_count, -1, 0) should make
this shout a false positive. Expectations don't always meet reality. My
expectations were based on the code, so I have added tracepoints to know
exactly what's going on.

Scenario 1: Successful probe -> unbind driver.

devm_pm_runtime_get_noresume() increases usage_count, and the call to
pm_runtime_put_autosuspend() decreases it. That is balanced, giving us
usage_count =3D 0 and putting the device in power down mode as desired. If
the device is then unbound, the devres action (a call to
pm_runtime_put_noidle_action, which only calls pm_runtime_put_noidle)
triggers a call to atomic_add_unless(&dev->power.usage_count, -1, 0).
Given that the usage count is 0, nothing happens and there is no
underflow. In fact, the underflow is not possible this way, and adding a
remove function to check if usage_count is 0 and calling
pm_runtime_put() is basically repeating what the devres action already
offers for free.

Scenario 2: write_event_config -> unbind driver.

Sashiko says that pm_runtime_resume_and_get() increases usage_count, and
there is no devres action associated to it. That is only partially
correct, because the devres action from devm_pm_runtime_get_noresume()
will be triggered when the driver is unbound. Actually, this is great
because then pm_runtime_resume_and_get() gets balanced, and there is no
need for a remove function to check again if usage_count is 0 or not. In
this case, usage_count =3D 1 before unbinding the driver, and then the
devres action is triggered when it gets unbound. Exactly what we want to
have usage_count =3D 0.
