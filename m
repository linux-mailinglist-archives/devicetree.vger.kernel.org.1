The 0-day but was a closed-source front-end to orchestrate analysis
tools that are open-source (compilers, static analyzers, ...). Sashiko
is an open-source front-end to orchestrate analysis tools that are
closed-source. That's the complete opposite, so I'm not sure how
relevant the comparison is. Comparing with Coverity may be more
relevant.
