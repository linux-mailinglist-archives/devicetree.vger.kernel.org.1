Do you mean 3.5 millions tokens per patch series? If so, that
sounds a lot! Why does it require too many tokens?

By "reproduce locally", I didn't mean in strict sense. Sure, LLM answers
won't be identical, but I suspect that at least most of the major issues=20
on a patch series would be reported by any decent model.

So, if we have something that one can locally run using its GPU, being
able to get an answer in the range of a couple of minutes per patch
should be enough to catch most of the issues.

Thanks,
Mauro
