so should it be for all the iommu groups?

                no_dma_mem {
                       reg = <0x0 0x8000000 0x0 0x100000>;
                        no-map;
                };
 
i think that's how we reserve memory in general, eg: ramoops
but this doesn't show up in:
  /sys/kernel/iommu_groups/*/reserved_regions

sorry, i haven't yet

I think this is the case we are dealing with?

/sys/../reserved_regions is working for certain devices like dma controller
but it doesn't work for pcie devices and its vfio-pcie driver calling
iommu_get_resv_regions() but we don't have dts node for vfio.
I have confirmed this about pcie on two different platforms, it seems to be
OF DMA-API gap that you hinted above, happy to work on that :), it would be
great if you can share any other reference discussions to that problem

When i specify this for dma controller:

		faulty_iova: resv_faulty {
			iommu-addresses = <&dmaX 0x8000000 0x100000>;
		};
&dmaX {
	memory-region = <&faulty_iova>;
};

I see following:
$ cat /sys/kernel/iommu_groups/y/reserved_regions 
0x0000000008000000 0x00000000080fffff reserved
0x00000000a0000000 0x00000000a00fffff msi

Clarifying the Issue with MSI and SMMU Faults on Our Platform:

We are encountering SMMU faults when using our userspace tool/driver that
relies on MSI. Specifically, the issue arises when the MSI_IOVA_BASE is set
to the current default value of 0x08000000.

The observed fault is as follows:

arm-smmu 64000000.iommu: Unhandled context fault: fsr=0x402, iova=0x00000040,
fsynr=0x2f0013, cbfrsynra=0x102, cb=15

Upon investigation, our hardware team confirmed that the memory region
containing 0x08000000 is already mapped for other peripherals, making it
unavailable for MSI usage.

eg: using 0xa0000000 as MSI_IOVA_BASE solves our problem.

let me know if you have any other questions

Thanks,
Shyam
