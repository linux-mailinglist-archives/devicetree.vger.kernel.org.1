In this whole discussion this is the one element that I think maybe needs
some additional clarification.

=46rom the datasheet it looks to me like there are actually separate data pat=
hs
per channel. There are separate SPI / LVDS data lines.

Its a decision in the backend design / FPGA to fuse them. That is logical
because as you've noted the cnv clock is shared. Or is it?  In the initial
diagram on the datasheet first page it is shown as shared, but there are ac=
tually
separate CNV_chA+- and CNV_chB+. It's a draft datasheet, so if you can feed=
back
to the author it would be good to make it more consistent!

It would be possible to build a similar setup with multiple discrete
ADCs connected to a single backend - I just don't think we've seen that done
yet.=20

Have I understood the above correctly?

My initial thoughts if we did would be a virtual / multiplexer
IIO device front end that was a consumer of the two separate IIO ADC device
instances (and probably had a path to their shared backend) + those two
instances would use the same backend. Thus the front end device could
provide the buffer interfaces. Without some prototyping I'm not sure how
we'd pull that together.

Note that I'm not suggesting this is the time to work out how to solve
that setup!

To my mind, this driver is effectively performing role of that front end and
the individual ADC instance drivers all in one. I think it's reasonable
to assume no one is going to buy this chip to use the channels independently
and if they do we can later work out how to make that work without this
initial path getting much in the way.

Agreed on this list.
