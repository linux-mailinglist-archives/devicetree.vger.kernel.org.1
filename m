This will confuse the users. Either do not print or print it all.

Yes, please.

Sounds to me like you need, probably, a virtual device for that.
Maybe even on IIO level. Do we expect more devices like this to
be enabled in the future (or maybe already in tree, but lacking this
feature)?

Sure, like any other resource for MFD (HW speaking).

Okay, so it's in a way more complex (like a camera sensor in terms of
data/configuration paths) device. It's now even more looking that the
current approach is a quick hack rather than a solution to make this
properly fit Linux device model.

This... It doesn't fit the data path as far as I read from the above.
