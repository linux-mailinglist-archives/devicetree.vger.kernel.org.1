Hmm... I forgot to include the burnout current in the DT bindings. Following
the channel = "conditions for measurement" pattern that I have set out here
I guess that would mean that we would need to have the same inputs twice
when using the burnout. One "channel" would be the one used to do a "precision"
measurement and the other would be the one to do open/short circuit detection.

As mentioned, it would look a bit like the ad_sigma_delta ADC driver.
Basically, each chip (family with same registers) would still have it's
own driver that include the chip-specific const info structs. In this
case, these would also include function pointers for all of the functions
that need to access registers. And there will be lots of supports_... bool
flags for the shared code to use.

I would not want to make a write-only attribute, we always want to be
able to read back what the current state is.

Do you mean an _enable for just the BOC? I think I would do it like I
suggested above instead.

There are only two IDACs but on chips with 8 AIN pins we could have two
RTDs wired up and if both require 2 IDACs, then we can't have a fixed
setting for the IDACs. This is why I made it per-channel.

See above.

I don't like to implement power management unless I have an application
that actually requires it. Otherwise, I consider it premature optimization.
It is difficult to know if we would be implementing it in a way that is
actually useful for a real-world use case. These chips seem like they
would mostly be used in an industrial setting, not in battery powered
applications, so I'm not sure anyone is going to worry about saving a few
milliamps.
