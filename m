It becomes more messy: The HDMI PHY cannot be used as clock source
for modes exceeding 4K@60Hz.

It is a problem, see e.g. this patch from Heiko removing the flag
for an RK3588 VOP source clock:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-rockchip/20251008133135.3745785-1-heiko@sntec=
h.de/

Also note, that there is some more general ongoing work regarding
this:

See: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-clk/20260327-clk-scaling-v8-0-86cd0aba3c=
5f@redhat.com/

There is also the problem that nearest match might be sensible for the
display, but is not generally safe. For other clocks you might
effectively overclock, which shouldn't be done by default.

Sorry, I don't have any complete solutions - except that I can tell
you that the VOP2 driver already automatically switches the clock
source to the HDMI PHY for HDMI outputs if the pixel rates allows it:
