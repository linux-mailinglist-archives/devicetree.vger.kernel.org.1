Right, it's a general guideline, not a hard and fast rule.

In most cases I'd suggest putting the tests in with the patch that
adds the piece they need to work.  That does mean that if some of the
simpler tests can operate with only some of the patches, moving those
tests earlier.

Again, only a guideline, but it helps review because the tests act as
documentation for the functionality the patch is adding.

Small is usually good.  However, if it's so small that the patch
doesn't express a complete idea so you have to keep referencing
surrounding patches to make sense of it, then it's no longer good.
Fwiw, think these patches are mostly well divided, but as above,
folding tests in with code changes is usually better because the tests
help show what the new code is expected to do.

[I will note that having the tests as a separate patch, usuallly
*before* the code changes is very useful during development.  But git
makes it pretty easy to re-order and fold things together when you're
ready to post]

Yes, but not quite as much.  And even less if those tests which can be
moved earlier are moved earlier.

Point taken.  For tests that intrinsically require things from
multiple earlier patches, having them separate probably makes sense.
Often at least some of the tests can be more closely related to a
single patch though.  When possible, that's generally preferable.

No, definitely don't do that.
