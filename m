Unless I misunderstand what you're saying, you're suggesting changing
the default for the non-emacs? I don't think this can be done, for the
same reason that your emac patch got reverted - it breaks existing
devices. With my suggestion, the driver support for refclk-ext would
remain, so as not to break any existing setups, but it would be removed
=66rom the binding or marked deprecated.

No, I don't think this is what I am suggesting. I am suggesting adding
USRIO_HAS_CLKEN to the gem configs, and then modifying the usrio struct
to have a member called something like "refclk_default_enable" and setting
it to true for emacs and false for gems. Then in init code somewhere, we
would do:

	if (property_present(refclk-source))
		if (property_read_string(refclk-source) =3D=3D "external"
			refclk_enable =3D true
		else
			refclk_enable =3D false
	else if (property_present(refclk-ext))
		refclk_enable =3D true
	else
		refclk_enable =3D usrio.refclk_default_enable

Then later on in init, when configuring the caps, we would do:

	if (!(bp->caps & MACB_CAPS_USRIO_DISABLED)) {

		if (bp->caps & MACB_CAPS_USRIO_HAS_CLKEN)
			val |=3D refclk_enable;

		macb_or_gem_writel(bp, USRIO, val);
	}

Or maybe we just roll all that up together inside the !USRIO_DISABLED
code.=20

The code currently in macb_configure_caps() about refclks would be
deleted.

This would produce one property that works for both emacs and gems, not
change any defaults for existing devices and retain support for whatever
devicetrees made it into the wild with your property.

Does that make sense?
