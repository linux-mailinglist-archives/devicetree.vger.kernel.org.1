I have started to implement this "unknown tag" feature based on the tag
values definition presented here and with complementary feature (bit
allowing to skip an unknown tag) as presented in patch 2 discussion [1].

I didn't introduce any FDT_INFO_xxx tags. They introduce nesting tags
and David seems not agree with that.

I use simple test tags to have some "unknown tags" in dtb and looked at
the way to handle them.

When we read a dtb, no problem, we just skip "unknown tags" if we are
allowed to (flag in tag value).

The issue comes when we modify a dtb.

libftd allows to modify a dtb. It allows to add/modify/remove properties
and nodes. Bootloaders for instance use this capability to update a dtb
before passing it to the kernel.

How should we handle unknown tags in this context?

We don't knwow about the meaning of those tags (unknown tags) and so, we
don't know if those tags are still consistent with modifications done?

A property can be followed by an unknown tags related to this property.
Also a property can be followed by an unknown tag related to the node.
We simply don't know.

Any modification can impact unknown tags and make them inconsistent.
Here again, we simply don't know.

Should we avoid any modification when a dtb contains unknown tags?
Should we simply remove all unknown tags when a modification is done?

Bootloaders need to modify the dtb. Avoiding modification is a no-go.
Removing "unknown tags" when a modification is done will lead to removing
all unknown tags at bootloader stage.

Rob, David, any opinion related to this specific issue and the strategy we
should follow when modification are involved?
