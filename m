HW is exactly the same. Let me give more insight on the setup. We have 
been using the HW in virtual environment but now the ownership of 
certain resources (e.g. clock controller etc.) is handed over to a 
different VM(non Linux VM). Earlier the ownership of the resources was 
local to the same VM(Linux VM) via passthrough mode so it could directly 
access them however now Linux VM talks to non-Linux VM for its 
operations for resources that it doesn't own anymore via some 
interface(shared memory/doorbell).Â  So shall we use property like 'qcom, 
controlled-remotely' or do we need a new compatible for such setup?
