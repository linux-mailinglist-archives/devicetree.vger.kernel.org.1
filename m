I wonder a bit if a single SPI device but with explicit control of which
CS index in the spi_messages or similar would work?  The disadvantage is you'd
probably want a lot of helpers to have variants with a selection parameter.

Would end up smelling like paged registers, just with a chip select to pick
the page rather than a page register.

If this isn't common, may not be worth the effort.
