I did a quick test on U-Boot and are preparing a series to add support
for multiple channels in U-Boot, see [2] for an early version that
should hit U-Boot ML in a day or two.

Found some other other issues when digging in the U-Boot pwm-regulator
code so ended up with a bigger series than anticipated, only the last
patch is related to preparation for multiple channels in rk-pwm driver.
