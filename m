So working around this would require some constraints in the binding
triggered off the compatible - but doable I think.

This feels like a driver detail rather than a binding one.

Ok. Sounds like we could do either but the different node type is cleaner.
So fair enough - go with that if the DT maintainers are happy with it.
Just make sure to lay out some of this reasoning in the commit message.
