Took me a while to get to this.=20

Another datapoint to perhaps look at is daisychain SPI devices. That's
moderately common on high end ADCs with applications such as electric car b=
attery
monitoring as they need to scale to 100s of devices and separate CS for eac=
h would
be a pain. =20

For those we just handled it in the ADC driver.

If we need to have a device specific aggregator driver to make any scheme w=
ork
then it might be better to just make it a driver problem.

Long ago I did some thinking about the fidlier problem of aggregating multi=
ple
unrelated device driver buffer outputs - was for sensor fusions stuff.
In the end I concluded it was easier to just do it in user space.  As long
as they ran off the same trigger then the data alignment problem wasn't too=
 hard.

Obviously here things are a bit different as the SPI offload IP is doing the
data marshalling.

If it's not doing hardware offload is it worth the pain?  Easy enough to do
it in userspace - particularly if we have timestamps as a bit of nearest
timestamp maths allows easy buffer alignment.

How common do we think this requirement is?  If it's just a couple of
devices I'd go a similar route to the daisy chaining case and do
something in the specific driver.  Maybe the only point of generalization
is the dt-bindings if we got that way.  Designing that to maybe let
us do a generic answer in the long term might be the right compromise
in not adding complexity to the core until it's proven to be needed.

Now if you have customers asking for it on 10 different devices today then
sure let's look at it sooner!  Even then it might be some library code that
the drivers use rather than big changes to the data flow in the IIO core.
