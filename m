Hi Dough,

thanks for your mail!

Let me just see if I understand correctly what you're trying to
do  (and apparently actively doing in production):

So in the kernel we have several arch/*/boot/dts/vendor/ folders
where they have:

soc.dtsi included by board.dtsi included by system.dts
and the top system.dts is all that get compiled.

So what you say is that you do the same thing but at runtime?

Can you just describe why this is done like this with
overlays?

I can only guess that you have one bootloader that needs
to compose device trees to many systems and the bootloader
only discovers the system it is running on and its constraints
at runtime, so shipping the static system.dtb as many people
do is not an option for you?

And the reason the bootloader doesn't already know what
it is running on and doesn't just pass that one device tree
or is just prepared with that one device tree has something
to do with manufacturing or so?

Sorry it just evades me.

Probably becayse even U-Boot these days use the provided
device tree dtb, for the system targeted, to initialize itself. I
suppose your bootloader is generic enough to avoid that
chicken-and-egg problem, right?

I guess if I had this problem:

soc.dtsi
board-a.dtsi
board-b.dtsi
system-board-a-v1.dts
system-board-a-v2.dts
system-board-b-v1.dts

etc having to be combined at runtime, in a bootloader, I would
consider shipping exactly these files in a memory-based
filesystem in my bootloader, and bake a DTS compiler into
my bootloader so it can just build a device tree for what
it detects.

But I guess you didn't want to hear that :D

Anyway, please describe how you ended up in this situation,
I'm trying to understand this.

It is quite clear that device tree overlays were intended for
say plug-n-play additions and minor fragments to be added
to a basically complete device tree, what you are doing was
probably not how it was intended. (Or let's see if someone
proves me wrong on that.)

Yours,
Linus Walleij
