Agreed this happens - but you can't really put it in DT as every device
then has it's own DT - which probably means an early boot firmware patching
the DT based on something in ROM or similar.  Given that is usually impract=
ical
we have handled this via firmware files - if no file, use defaults.

I'm fine with doing that if we are sure the coefficients are incorporating
windows in front of the sensor.  I know that wasn't the case for some
of the previous devices we've covered - typically because they either
had pretty optically clear windows - or didn't have one at all.
