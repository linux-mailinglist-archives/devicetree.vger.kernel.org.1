I'm running the mainline Trusted Firmware-A v2.13. I'm not familiar with
the code base, but tracing the cpu_standby operation, I haven't seen any
code interacting directly with the EQOS.

That's something I am suspecting too, but reading the code I don't see
where it would occur. I've also tried to see if we could be missing
power domain handling for the EQOS, but I don't see a mention of a
related power domain in the reference manual or the BSP kernel.

Interestingly, running `stress -c 5` helps, so the issue seems related
to CPUs getting suspended. However, I appear to have previously spoken
too fast. While reverting the cpuidle state commit helps with the
interrupt storm, it doesn't fully get rid of it. I still get several
hundreds of thousands of EQOS interrupts during boot. The situation then
appears to calm down after boot completes. Adding the `eee-broken-1000t`
property, on the other hand, gets rid of the problem completely and
interrupt counts return back to normal. It may therefore be that the
problem was present before cpuidle states were introduced, but with a
low-enough impact at runtime that they went unnoticed.

Yes I have. The document is available at
https://www.nxp.com/webapp/Download?colCode=IMX8MP_1P33A (it annoyingly
requires an NXP account, but is otherwise publicly accessible). There
are three items related to the EQOS:

- ENET_QOS: Failure to generate Fatal Bus Error interrupt when
  descriptor posted write is enabled

- ENET_QOS: MAC incorrectly discards the received packets when Preamble
  Byte does not precede SFD or SMD

- ENET_QOS: Scheduled transmit packet not sent in the allotted slot or
  the remaining fragment of a Preempted Packet incorrectly dropped due
  to scheduling timeout in the EST GCL

Those do not seem related. I haven't seen any other errata entries that
seem related.

Here's a lockup report I've received from the kernel while testing:
