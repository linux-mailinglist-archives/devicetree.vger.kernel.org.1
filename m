Apologies for the delay responding, been sick the last week.
I think what you have here is not unreasonable, but may never have users
other than yourself! It's effectively gated-fixed-clock but the gpio
direction is inverted. I'm not keen on the "guarded" wording, but I
think I would want you to become a fixed-clock variant w/ a prefix that
indicates what's different. Then you get locked-gpios instead of
enable-gpios that gated-fixed-clock has.

Or maybe you're a gpio-gate-clock variant instead, and represent the PLL
as a fixed-clock (but I think being a fixed-clock variant makes more
sense).
