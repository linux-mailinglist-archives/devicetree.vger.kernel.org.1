Couldn't this be something like:

AI-analysed-by: bot-X

Sometimes we expect them to run and produce results, that we should
check, and in my experience act upon and sometimes ignore, as usual with
any type of comments, when I don't get those results I usually go and
look at the web interface, be it the public one or the private one I use
(while contributing to one of them, sashiko for full disclosure), to see
if it is just that it is taking longer to process that specific patch or
if it really finished.

If I go in the morning to look at my inbox and see everything there it
reduces some steps for me.

So, yeah, Reviewed-by is definetly for definetly persons, but having
some tag that states that it went thru automated reviewing^Wanalysis by
a definetly bot/thing/whatever that some people think is useful seems
useful.

And of course I think this should be all opt-in by each and every
maintainer, this definetly is not something to be uniformly agreed on,
so if some mechanism is put in place for, say, sashiko, to reply that it
didn't find any problem with a particular patch for the subsystem I'm
involved with, then I'd like for that info to be provided as a reply to
the message.

Cheers,
