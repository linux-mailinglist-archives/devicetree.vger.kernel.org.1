From a quick scan, that seems reasonable looking to me. The main thing
that got my attention was the namespace labels thing which I'll need
to study more.

I guess "addons" is overlays 2.0. Do you envision any use for overlays
1.0 after this? I wouldn't think so other than compatibility for
existing overlays.

Maybe a conversion tool and/or function would be useful (not asking
for that now).

This is very much aligned with what I would like to see. We've
discussed new DTB formats in the past and it becomes a laundry list of
changes likely resulting in something entirely different. I think
that's never going to move forward (it's only been discussed for 10+
years). I think doing something like this is much easier to define and
deploy.

I think the first step is just allowing the FDT format to have
additional tags with metadata that's not yet defined. Ideally that
would be just "allow unknown tags" instead of giving a parsing error.
However, I think we have to at least know the length of data for
unknown tags, so maybe we define a range of tag values which are
followed by a length. Either way, that should be a pretty small change
and easily deployed everywhere (that uses libfdt). After that, then we
can start to define the specific tags and meta-data we want. I would
like to see not just phandle info, but all type information for
example.

The addition of phandle info is also useful for fw_devlink (which is
the kernel's device dependency tracking), and I've been talking with
Saravana some about an approach like this.

More generally, would these just be "node metadata" tags?
