Perhaps further complicating matters.

I have a Debix Model A as well ... I'm in a different office to Laurent
- and I believe EEE is enabled on my board/network switch.

I do not get an interrupt storm.

I'm not sure how this helps yet, - I don't know what to debug as I can't
reproduce the issue!

I can provide remote access to the board with ssh if that helps anyone
who wants to look at something specific about my setup or run anything
if anyone has ideas of what to check my side.

Perhaps we can find some subtle difference between a working case and a
non-working case...
