But EXTCON_PROP_USB_TYPEC_POLARITY is just a Type-C, nothing about DP in it.

This is clear.

If QMP PHY is a plain DP PHY, it usually has no support for lane remapping
(e.g. phy-qcom-edp doesn't).

Let me reiterate, please: lane management is outside of the DisplayPort
spec, at least as far as I can understand it. All lane remapping
(especially a dynamic one) is a pure vendor extension to the standard.
I'm trying to find a way to support Corsola and Trogdor without adding
"this is done specially for Google" kind of API. Usually that doesn't
fly in the long term.

I understand that using Type-C API for the DRM bridge sounds strange.
But even the mentioned bridge uses Type-C API. It asks for the Type-C
polarity, not the DP polarity.

I think just "orientation-switch" is enough. In the end it's not a
"typec-orientation-switch".
