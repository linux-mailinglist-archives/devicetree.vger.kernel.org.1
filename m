Yes, this is the suggestion.  One writeable kcontrol on the USB SND audio device that will control if that USB audio device is going to be offloaded.  If the kcontrol reads back "enabled" (or 1) then userspace knows that the offload path is active.  Else, if it reads "disabled" (or 0) after the attempt to set the kcontrol, then the offload path was unsuccessfully enabled, ie maybe due to no available offload streams.

That is what I have implemented in the previous patch series.  One USB SND kcontrol within each USB audio device, which points to the ASoC platform card that supports offloading:

"USB Offload Playback Capable Card" --> returns the card index to the ASoC platform card

From there the offloading control is all within the ASoC platform card.  This is opposite to what Amaduesz suggested in that, the offload control of which USB device to offload should be within USB SND (not ASoC)

>> Expanding on Amadeusz's suggestion, my idea is to have an enable/disable kcontrol per USB stream.  For example, one USB card could have multiple PCM devices (USB streams).  So we would have something like:

No, writable and readable.

It won't help with the mapping.  That is something which we'd need to add, suggestion below.

OK, so now to just figuring out something that both you and Amadeusz can agree on before I put time implementing it.  So I've implemented the "enable/disable" path that Amadeusz suggested, which is highlighted in my previous response, for evaluation purposes.  The overall question is which layer should control the devices that will be offloaded.  In my submissions up until now, the control was given to the ASoC platform card to determine which USB device to offload.  Amadeusz mentioned that it might be beneficial to move the control to the USB SND devices, because what if the offloading is NOT backed by ASoC. (highlighted in [1])  However, IMO the current implementation assumes there is ASoC involved, which should mean that there is some platform "card" that is backing the offload path.  Please let me know if my understanding is incorrect, @Amadeusz.
