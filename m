This is partly true, indeed. On one side there's the need to avoid a
specific node name ('rp1_nexus'), so the only other unique identifier would
be the compatible string ('pci1de4,1' in this case, which identifies that specific
device). Unfortunately, the same compatible string is also assigned to the pci
endpoint node filled automatically by enabling CONFIG_PCI_DYNAMIC_OF_NODES.
We would end up with two nodes with the same compatible, which is not unique
anymore. 
This applies only when using 'full' dtb (bcm2712-rpi-5-b.dtb) *and* you enable
CONFIG_PCI_DYNAMIC_OF_NODES, the latter being not necessary since the overlay dtb
(...-ovl-rp1.dtb) is not in use here. To overcome this problem, the solutions
I can think of are the following:

1- Just disable CONFIG_PCI_DYNAMIC_OF_NODES should work, but only when using the
   full dtb version. However, if the user enable that option for debug or to use
   the overlay dtb version, he better be sure not to use teh full dtb or it won't
   work.
   This solution seems really weak.

2- Add another compatible string other than 'pci1de4,1', so it will be really
   unique.

Yes, if we want to get rid of that nasty warning and comply with DT guidelines,
I think I really need to fix that.

The 'full' dtb (bcm2712-rpi-5-b.dtb) is indeed statically populated.
CONFIG_PCI_DYNAMIC_OF_NODES is needed only if you use the overlay approach
(bcm2712-rpi-5-b-ovl-rp1.dtb) and in that case the node will be
added to the correct device node at runtime, and there won't be any node
labeled as rp1_nexus.
That conditional just check for teh presence of the rp1_nexus node to
choose if the overlay should be loaded at runtime (if rp1_nexus is present,
then we are in the static case so no overlay need to be loaded).

drivers/misc/rp1/rp1-pci.dtso is just a wrapper over rp1-common.dtsi,
which is to be compiled in as binary blob in the driver and loaded at
runtime.
rp1.dtbo is optional, it's there just for completeness in case anyone want
to load teh overlay from the fw, as explained here:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/ab9ab3536baf5fdf6016f2a01044f00034189291.1742418429.git.andrea.porta@suse.com/
If it causes confusion, we can probably get rid of it with no penalty.

Many thanks,
Andrea
