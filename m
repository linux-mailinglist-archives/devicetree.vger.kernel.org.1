Agree it makes sense to make region 0xc450000 a syscon node provided
it's shared by two distinct devices (the controller and the PHY). I will
implement this change in the next version.
A heads up, I will also need to send a new version for the corresponding
dwc3 controller binding patch that has already been reviewed [1] to reflect
this syscon change.

As for region 0x0c637000, this range is exclusive to this PHY device, which
includes both eUSB2 PHY and USB3.2/DP combo PHY. (It would be a
different story if the USB2 PHY and the USB3 PHY were to be treated as
two distinct devices.) Therefore, I'm hesitant to convert this region to a
syscon node. I recommend keeping the region as-is and add a more
detailed description for this reg entry to clarify that this is top-level
subsystem wrapper registers distinct from the core IP's register space.

Yes, I can definitely share the DTS I'm using to test this PHY and controll=
er
patch series. Could you recommend the most appropriate way to do so?
I came across a previous patch thread [2] that used gist link for sharing c=
ode
snippets and logs. Is that generally considered acceptable?
