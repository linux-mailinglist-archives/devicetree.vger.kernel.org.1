I don't think the single user functionality is considered generic.

Also, if that one designed for the case, why is needed patching?

...

The  mentioned approach predates the SPI memory chip support being
integrated into SPI core. I think we should consider to kill
spi_new_ancillary_device() in favour of using the same mechanism
as being used for SPI mem chips.
