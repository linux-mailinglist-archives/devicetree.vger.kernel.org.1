Fair enough for not providing DT nodes for those unsupported chips, but 
why do we need to force enumeration? For the eventual Bluetooth usage, 
the driver will find the respective serial interface by just looking at 
its parent interface. IIUC there is nothing referring to ttyS1 
explicitly. So we wouldn't really need an alias, would we?
I see that some boards do define an alias, but others with Bluetooth 
don't, which I think is the right thing to do. Which name the kernel 
comes up with for UART1 shouldn't matter in any way.

Ah, yeah, somehow missed that line. So as stated below, please use a 
descriptive regulator name.
Look at sun55i-a527-cubie-a5e.dts, I think is a more modern example of 
how to handle regulators best.

Ah yeah, the Liontron is not the best example, we don't have the full 
description there, because this board misses schematics.
So look at sun55i-a527-cubie-a5e.dts instead, which uses the top level 
regulator correctly. We didn't traditionally do this with the A64 boards 
using the AXP803, and just learned to live with those dummy supplies 
created by the kernel, but for new boards we should do better.

Regarding the board/SoM split: You should have a fixed regulator in the 
SoM .dtsi reflecting the 5V input pin(s), and then using that as the VIN 
  supply for the various PMIC rails, as the Cubie A5E does. This would 
mimic some barrel connector on a standard board: the voltage is applied 
"by the user", externally.
So in this SoM .dtsi node, there is no vin-supply property, but you add 
that in the board .dts:

&reg_vcc5v {
	vin-supply = <&reg_vcc12v5v>;
};
Please come up with some better names than I just did ;-) Maybe 
something like reg_vcc5v_som to make this clearer.

And then you have that 12V->5V regulator described in the board .dts, 
along with a parent-less 12V regulator, check sun55i-t527-avaota-a1.dts 
for an example.

That should work cleanly, I think.

I guess that's the same situation as in the other recent boards using 
USB-C: they hardwired it to peripheral mode, although you can use this 
as a host port with some tricks, check sun50i-h616-orangepi-zero.dtsi, 
and copy this comment, should it apply.

What do you mean with OTG side hub, exactly? Is there a hub on USB0? How 
does this work, then?
