This would mean we wouldn't be able to use iio_chan_spec .channel and
.channel2 to describe inputs because of duplicate sysfs attributes, no?

Yeah, I don't know why I said WO. Reading would be fine too.

No, no just the BOC. The BOC, IDAC and rest of side effects. Thinking
about it some more, it would be a bit redundant but clearer if proper
documentation is provided.

I'll make it per-channel too.

Makes sense. I can probably drop the autosuspend in that case.
