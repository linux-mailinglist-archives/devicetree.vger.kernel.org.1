The difference is those cases (for what few pse-psd bindings there are)
the compatibles correspond to individual devices. Here you have
compatibles you're going to use to cover multiple devices (with device
corresponding to a combination of mcu/firmware/hardware behind the mcu).
That lack of a 1:1 mapping is why I'm asking for something different from
you than you see with the existing pse-pd devices. The switch the device
is integrated on seems to be the only thing that reasonably makes sense
to use.

And in doing so, have to retrofit that compatible to all devicetrees
that use it. This is one of the reasons that we generally demand
device-specific compatibles.

You could add switch-specific compatibles that fall back to the ones you
provide above, with the driver only using the ones above unless
something crops up in the future?

Cheers,
Conor.
