Subject: [PATCH v2] ARM: dts: bcm2835: Enable 3D rendering through V3D
Date: Mon, 15 Apr 2024 13:00:39 -0300

RPi 0-3 is packed with a GPU that provides 3D rendering capabilities to
the RPi. Currently, the downstream kernel uses an overlay to enable the
GPU and use GPU hardware acceleration. When deploying a mainline kernel
to the RPi 0-3, we end up without any GPU hardware acceleration
(essentially, we can't use the OpenGL driver).

Therefore, enable the V3D core for the RPi 0-3 in the mainline kernel.

v1 -> v2: https://lore.kernel.org/dri-devel/41694292-af1f-4760-a7b6-101ed5dd6f9d@gmx.net/T/

* As mentioned by Krzysztof, enabling should be done in last place of
	override/extend. Therefore, I'm disabling V3D in the common dtsi
	and enabling in the last place of extend, i.e. the RPi DTS files.
