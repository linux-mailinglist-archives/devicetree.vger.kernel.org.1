If Google and/or others are willing to give free credits on their cloud,
they could instead or in addition give free credits to run ollama
there, allowing us to use different models.

=46rom my side, while I won't personally object getting reviews from
Sashiko/Gemini, this is something I can't reproduce locally. I would
very much want something where I can select my LLM preferred model
and run on my ollama docker container on my own GPU, in a way that
I could run it locally before even sending a patch series.

It is not about the model itself. It is about being able to easily
install a sashiko locally on a container and easily make it use my
ollma server with the model(s) of my choice. Right now, at least at=20
from its README.md, it sounds that only closed source services
are supported.
