As this is the second problem that has been reported recently, please
bisect the conversion of stmmac to phylink managed EEE support and see
whether there is anything in that which is causing this.

Please also confirm that EEE was enabled (as soon through ethtool)
prior to stmmac's conversion (I believe it was due to this code that
was present in stmmac_init_phy():

-               if (priv->dma_cap.eee)
-                       phy_support_eee(phydev);
-
                ret = phylink_connect_phy(priv->phylink, phydev);

The changes to stmmac have been tested on nVidia Jetson Xavier NX,
which uses RGMII with dwmac4 and a RTL8211F PHY, connected to a Netgear
GS108 switch. It seems to be the same that your board is using similar.

I will re-test today.
