or be more description, e.g.: compatible-scope = "soc"  - or just scope = "soc"

In other words, I don't think we should be frightened to define some
levels (soc, som, carrier, exxpansion, chassis?)

Another option would be to validate the soc DT with a chosen board,
just as a workaround. It would probably be good enough.

This seems important, yes.

This proposal seems good to me.

We don't need to worry about old bootloaders since they presumably are
not installed on new hardware. Assuming Linux adopts this proposal, I
am sure people will implement it in bootloaders when they need to.

Chen-Yu, thank you for the reminder re my extensions thing for FIT. I
had forgotten about that. Here are some current proposed FIT
additions, BTW, in case anyone is interested in taking a look:
