For pure peripheral mode we don't need them, but it wouldn't harm to have
them anyway, and later on we will want to have them.

As mentioned in the other mail, please stick to RSB.

Please try to be as precise as possible. The BSP used 0.94V, if I remember
the dumps correctly, so it's better to stick with that single value.
*Changing* such a critical voltage during runtime sounds like asking for
trouble, and given the recent experience with GPU DVFS on the A64, I'd say
we stick with a single voltage.
Also a range only makes sense if the consumer knows about that and
supports a change, examples are the SD card I/O voltage, or the CPU
supply, for DVFS. But most devices just *enable* their regulator. So this
would leave the voltage at whatever was set before, which does not sound
helpful if this was wrong or slightly off for whatever reason.

Yeah, that's a good name.
