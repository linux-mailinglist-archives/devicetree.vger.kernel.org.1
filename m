The problem with #1 is a) new platforms can then repeat the same mistake 
and b) we'll forget what platforms needed some work-around and whether 
we still need to maintain such a work-around. Well, I might not forget, 
but the next DT maintainer (applications welcome!) even won't know. For 
example, I have know clue if we still need to carry some of the 
work-arounds embedded into the interrupt parsing code. That all 
predates me. The only way I find out is breaking them (I'll never 
understand why people still run PowerMacs from the 1990s).

Calling the fixup code a layer is an exageration. It's on my kernel.org 
tree in the dt/fixup-infrastruct branch. And look, guess what issue it 
was that it has a fixup for.

Shrug. I thought the ABI was a concern here. It's ultimately up to the 
maintainers and users of a given platform whether or not they care about 
the ABI.
