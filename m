Ok, I will not use 'TYPE' in the name of those tags.

They won't be used in plugins. Other mechanism are available in plugind.
My idea was to to keep things consistent.

I mean, pluggin dtb can have metadata. Having metadata doesn't mean that
they must be used.

FDT_REF_PHANDLE (or other name) makes sense in plugin dtb.

Is FDT_REF_PHANDLE valid for plugin dtb, the answer is yes.

Will FDT_REF_PHANDLE be used for symbol resolution in the plugin case, the
answer is no, other mechanisme are used (__fixups__ node).

yes, the addon dtb is for a single addon.

yes, depending on where the addon is attached, the symbol resolution can re=
ach
different nodes. Is that several "meanings", not sure.

=46rom the addon: prop =3D <&i2c>;

Depending on node the addon is applied this could be resolved to the node
i2c@xxxx or i2c@yyyy but for sure it will be resolved to a node describing
an i2c controller.
