Same hardware means all the peripherals are same as of previous gen SoCs apart
from usual improvements. Maybe I confused you by saying that this interface is
only applicable for newer SoCs, that is not accurate.

So for instance, even if you take SM8550, Qcom can use this interface (VM) and
ship it to a customer. The VM is just part of the bootloader package. So if the
VM is shipped with an SoC, then Linux should not try to handle resources for the
peripherals and instead request VM to do so using the SCMI interface. Much like
how ACPI behaves in the x86 world. But how the OS should be made aware of the
presence of VM is the question here. Qcom likes to convey that information using
DT.

Well, this decision (whether to use a different compatible or a property)
impacts all the peripheral teams inside Qcom as the driver update heavily
depends on this decision. So let's try to conclude the decision here itself.
If something is not clear, please say as you said above. I'll try my best to
clarify.
