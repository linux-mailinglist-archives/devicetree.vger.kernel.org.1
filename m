If that is a separate overlay fragment (i.e. not under another node in
the overlay), we could solve this by having some way to mark the
fragment as optional. Apply it if the base node is present, but don't
fail if not. Could be a need for this without overlays as well.
Something like this:

#include <soc.dtsi>

/optional/ &sata {
  foo =3D <0>;
};

Normally if 'sata' isn't found, that's an error.

To make that work for overlays, we'd have to transform /optional/ into
a property. "target-optional" alongside "target-path" perhaps.

I think you just give up and generalize it: "SolidRun HummingBoard/Cubox"

So we're back to needing to merge compatible even though Doug was
willing to drop it. Or to put it another way, there's usecases for the
base to be different SoC revisions and variants. So I don't think we
should give up on solving that.

Looks like FIT...

I tend to agree your cases might be the tip of the iceberg. I think
someone has to take some existing platforms and see what happens
splitting them.

We've generally resisted making filenames significant/ABI.
