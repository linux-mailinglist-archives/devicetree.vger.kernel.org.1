That's great.  To be honest it sounds like you're already very up to
speed so I'm not sure I'm going to have anything here that isn't pretty
generic.

One big thing with embedded stuff like this is hardware access to test -
an awful lot of stuff is going to be hard to work on just purely with
software.  Given that it's probably useful to take a look at what
systems you have or can readily get hold of and then consider what
problems they have that might be good to work on - things like board
enablement would be an obvious example there, and it's common that
boards have some support but pretty basic so there's useful things can
be done extending that (eg, leaving a lot of features unused and just
supporting basic playback/capture).  Knowing what you've got to hand
would make it a lot easier to suggest concrete ideas.

It's worth noting that a lot of x86 laptops these days are ASoC based,
their SoCs are built in the same way as mobile SoCs, so might be worth
considering those too.
