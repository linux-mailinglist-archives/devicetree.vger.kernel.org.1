Well, this has the bitter taste of requiring the PWM driver, so it wouldn't
work with current kernels. As the DTs are independent from the kernel,
this is some kind of regression: with the current DT it works on every
kernel, but using an updated DT (using PWM) the LED would stay off.
So it needs to be seen whether it's worth it. Maybe it works when U-Boot
powers this on, and Linux wouldn't touch it, when there is no PWM support.
Anyway that's indeed something to consider later, just wanted to mention
it.

Typically some kind of ordering is preferred, to avoid confusion as to
where put new nodes. And if in doubt, this is indeed alphabetical.

As mentioned in the other mail, there are VCC-USB and VCC-USB2 pins on the
SoC, requiring 3.3V for the internal USB logic/PHY.
But it would be odd to see that on a GPIO controlled regulator, since IIUC
this is essential for USB operation, so would affect the FEL mode as well,
which is driven early by the BROM, knowing nothing about the board
specifics.
So I would expect any AXP rails (except those being on at reset) or GPIO
regulators only being responsible for *host mode* related power - FEL mode
does not need that, it's just peripheral mode. But since the AXP has reset
defaults, it might be an AXP rails that drives VCC-USB.

As mentioned, 4.6V would make sense if that's the pass-through from the
input power. It's probably already not 5.0V anymore when it comes in, and
might drop further under load.

That's interesting, but I highly doubt that Anbernic would slap an
expensive buck/boost converter to something uncritical as the WiFi supply.
So there might be something different at play here? Are you able to get
any hints from looking at the PCB and the traces? Those regulators are
typically easy to spot.

That makes sense, and would mean that CLDO3 is enabled on AXP reset and
set to 3.3V. The AXP datasheet is not helpful, and typically just refers
to "EFUSE" when it comes to the reset values.

Would you be able to poke the AXP early? Maybe drop the AXP driver from
U-Boot proper, and read the registers from U-Boot via the i2c command? To
see what the default values and enabled state is for all rails?

The easiest solution would just wire the PortC pins directly to the SD
card socket, and whatever VCC-PC is, would be used.
There is the possibility to have switchable level shifters between the SoC
and the SD card slot, to be able to switch between 1.8V and 3.3V, for
UHS-1 operation. But I doubt that Anbernic would go this way, since this
sounds more expensive, for little benefit.

So we don't need them for pure peripheral mode, but for host mode they are
needed. Technically the MUSB controller also supports host mode, but IIUC
Allwinner doesn't use this setup, and recommends the proper HCIs for host
mode.

In general we prefer RSB. If nothing else: it's faster (3MHz instead of
100/400 KHz), which gives a slight advantage for fast DVFS switching. Also
it's easier to program - each register write is a single fire-and-forget
setup in the RSB registers, as opposed to much more driver hand-holding
for I2C. That doesn't really matter for Linux (which supports both), but
helps TF-A, for instance.

I would assume the buck converters use the input power, since this is the
least current limited of all available, and the outputs promise quite some
current capability.
For the LDOs it might make sense to use a lower, closer matching input
voltage, so it only has to drop from say 3.3V to 1.8V, but for the DCDCs
using reg_vcc5v would make sense.

Though on second thought I wonder how this works when the device runs on
battery. Need to check the manual on how it handles the battery switch,
but I think for now it's safe to go with that above.

You need lots of booze for anything BSP related ;-)

But indeed the lowest OPP voltage is 900mV, so it would make sense to go
with that.

It's probably used for both: on other H616 boards we call this regulator
"vdd-gpu-sys". The datasheet describes both voltages with the same
constraints, and since you need quite some oomph for both, and it's an odd
voltage, it makes sense to use one DCDC for this.

Thanks, that makes sense, since 1.8V is needed quite a lot.

Right, fair enough: the H616/H700 does not have a management processor, so
the SoC probably does not need some kind of standby voltage.

Ah, many thanks for doing this - and sounds also fun, actually ;-)

Mmmh, interesting, though this might mean we don't understand this very
well yet. Because it looks like easy on the board side: just connect the
CC pins on the AXP to the CC pins on the connector, and the rest falls in
place?
