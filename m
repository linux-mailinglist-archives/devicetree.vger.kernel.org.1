You can see we have contacted each other in community, and decided to
cooperate in this way to honor his contribution. But final decision is
left for the community to decide:

 From Zong Li:

We respect all contributions, We'll add the link in cover letter to the
follow-up revisions, let me know if anything else should be done to the
new revisions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

And let me describe in details to compare the functionalities and
addressed comments between what is provided by Joey and by Zong:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250115030306.29735-1-zong.li@sifive.com/

There is no missing functionalities between the two approaches, I also
checked the original Robin's comments, let me describe them in details:

1. The following comments require a split CYCLES implementation:

comment 1:
 >> Why not use an extra config bit to encode cycles events completely
 >> independently of the regular eventID space? Or even just use 0 since
 >> by definition that cannot overlap a valid eventID?

comment 2:
 >> It's also horribly confusing to use GENMASK for something which is
 >> not actually a mask at all.

comment 3:
 >> Hmm, from experience I would expect these variables to be
 >> number-of-counters related, but I guess there must be some special
 >> cleverness going on since that number-of-counters looking
 >> RISCV_IOMMU_HPM_COUNTER_NUM definition is conspicuously not used,

 >>
 >> ...event selectors? But with a magic +1 for reasons so obvious they
 >> clearly don't need explaining.

comment 4:
 >> One of those conditions is literally impossible, the other should
 >> already be avoided by construction.

comment 5:
 >> I don't think you need this - as best I can tell, you never
 >> initialise a counter without also (re)enabling the interrupt (which
 >> is logical), so since "value" for the cycle counter should always
 >> implicitly have OF=0 anyway, it should work to just write it like the
 >> other counters.

comment 6:
 >> Is RISCV_IOMMU_IOHPMCTR_COUNTER honestly useful? Or is it actively
 >> hurting readability by obfuscating that we are in fact just using the
 >> full 64-bit value in all those places?

comment 7:
 >> And that's a very creative way to spell "if (idx == 0)".

comment 8:
 >> (and as above, I think you can make this a no-op for the cycle
 >> counter)

These comments require a software architecture change to handle CYCLES
in a neat way. CYCLES is split and handled in the clean way in
iommu-hpm.

2. The following comments require an uncore non-sampling mechanism:

comment 1:
 >> You also need a "cpumask" attribute to tell userspace this is a
 >> system/uncore PMU.

comment 2:
 >> None of this is relevant or necessary. This is not a CPU PMU, so it
 >> can't support sampling because it doesn't have a meaningful context
 >> to sample.

comment 3:
 >> You first need to validate that the event is for this PMU at all,
 >> and return -ENOENT if not.

comment 4:
 >> As above, you can't support sampling events anyway, so you should
 >> reject them with -EINVAL.
 >>
 >> You also need to validate event groups to ensure they don't contain
 >> more events than could ever be scheduled at once.

comment 5:
 >> This will never do anything, since even if we could ever get here,
 >> it would not be at a time when there are any active events.
 >> Unregistering an in-use PMU does not end well (hence why standalone
 >> PMU drivers need to use suppress_bind_attrs)...

Here, Joey does check PMU type, does not include sampling event stuffs,
and cpuhp is handled in a fine grained locking way. And since locking is
handled correctly, it's safe to keep iommu-hpm as tristate.
The new approach requires more system software architecture techniques.

3. The following comments require a IRQ handling improvement:

comment 1:
 >> TBH I'd be inclined to just leave out all the dead cleanup code if
 >> the  PMU driver is tied to the IOMMU driver and can never
 >> realistically be removed.

comment 2:
 >> Surely this should only touch the counter(s) that overflowed and
 >> have been handled? It might be cleaner to keep that within the IRQ
 >> handler itself.

comment 3:
 >> This needs to start all active counters together, not one-by-one.

comment 4:
 >> This does nothing, since set_event has just implicitly written
 >> OF=0.
 >>
 >> ...unless, that is, the user was mischievous and also set bit 63
 >> in event->attr.config, since you never sanitised the input ;)

comment 5:
 >> What do these regs represent? If you look at the perf_event_open

 >> and/or pid, but there is no encoding for "whichever CPU takes the
 >> IOMMU PMU interrupt". Thus whatever you get here is more than likely
 >> not what the user asked for, and this is why non-CPU PMUs cannot
 >> reasonably support sampling ;)

comment 6:
 >> You still need to handle counter rollover for all events, otherwise
 >> they can start losing counts and rapidly turn to nonsense. Admittedly
 >> it's largely theoretical with full 64-bit counters, but still...

comment 7:
 >> Hmm, shared interrupts are tricky for PMUs, since perf requires any

 >> very careful about maintaining affinity and not letting anyone else
 >> change it behind your back.
 >>
 >> The other thing is that if it really is shared, at this point you
 >> could now be in riscv_iommu_pmu_handle_irq() dereferencing NULL.

comment 8:
 >> In general it's not a great idea to register an IRQ handler before
 >> the data passed to that handler is initialised. What is pointed to by

 >>
 >> (OK, it's not *literally* NULL, but hey...)

Here OVF interrupt is handled as a standalone threaded per-cpu shared
IRQ in iommu-hpm.c and iocountinh register is not used as OVF interrupt
is always enabled and overflows is stored to software counters. The new
approach passed testings.

4. Other programming style fixes, they are all not in this patch.

comment 1:
 >> sysfs_emit()

No such problem here.

comment 2:
 >> Might be worth leaving a comment just in case anyone does try to
 >> enable this for 32-bit that the io-64-nonatomic readq() isn't enough
 >> to work properly here.

Not addressed in v3 and v4. And probably not necessary.

comment 3:
 >> That's a wonderfully expensive way to spell
 >> "pmu->events[idx]->hw.config"...

No such problem here, get_event() is used.

comment 4:
 >> Initially this looks weird - why bother storing constants in memory
 >> if they're constant? - but I see the spec implies they are not
 >> necessarily fixed, and we can only actually assume at least one
 >> counter at least 32 bits wide, so I guess this is really more of

 >> writing all 1s to various registers to see what sticks, or is it
 >> liable to be a mess of just having to know what each implementation
 >> has by matching DT compatibles and/or PCI IDs?

Here WARL registers are handled in RISC-V programming style.

comment 5:
 >> The new thing is that you can now set pmu.parent to the IOMMU device
 >> so their relationship is clear in sysfs, rather than having to play
 >> tricks with the PMU name.

Not addressed here but addressed in v4.

IMO, the Joey's approach addressed issue 1, 2 and 3, which does require
more software architecture changes. Her contribution and authorship
might also be honored.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Am I missing something in the above list? Robin might help to confirm if
the new approach has addressed all his comments.

Thanks and best regards,
Lv
