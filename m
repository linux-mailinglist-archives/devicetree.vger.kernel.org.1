What is the explanation to remove the (hardware default) CPU power
supply 0.9V operation, and remove hardware default CPU speed?

I would think you will want jh7110.dtsi similar as follows:

        cpu_opp: opp-table-0 {
                        compatible = "operating-points-v2";
                        opp-shared;
                        opp-250000000 {
                                        opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <250000000>;
                                        opp-microvolt = <800000>;
                        };
                        opp-333000000 {
                                        opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <333000000>;
                                        opp-microvolt = <800000>;
                        };
                        opp-375000000 {
                                        opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <375000000>;
                                        opp-microvolt = <800000>;
                        };
                        opp-500000000 {
                                        opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <500000000>;
                                        opp-microvolt = <800000>;
                        };
                        opp-750000000 {
                                        opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <750000000>;
                                        opp-microvolt = <800000>;
                        };
                        opp-1000000000 {
                                        opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <1000000000>;
                                        opp-microvolt = <900000>;
                        };
                        opp-1500000000 {
                                        opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <1500000000>;
                                        opp-microvolt = <1040000>;
                        };
        };

I guess at the voltages here, you will have to provide a correction
about what is realistic.

Board makers are designing their board layout with opp-1000000000
default voltage with default clock frequency and not opp-1500000000 on
an increased voltage and maximum clock speed yes?

We should not exceed the hardware default CPU voltage (and clock
frequency) for all boards without some very good reason, and I do not
accept "because more voltage and higher frequency is faster" to be a
reason to do this.

Hal, you have not explained why it is *necessary* to have this
non-default voltage and clock frequency table for all boards. I know
that using a JH7110 board that allows 1.5GHz operation results in
thermal over-temperature and shutdown, where it then does no work at all
and is not useful to me. I do accept that you want 1.5GHz operation, for
a specific board that is no problem with me because I do not have that
board to test if it is any problem; I have to trust that you have done
this testing, then.

Summary of my thoughts are:

1. Yes to support for lower and higher core voltage and clock frequency

2. No to imposing non-default hardware profiles on all boards, unless
there is some actual reason why it is strictly necessary (thermal
performance testing, operational stability, power savings, ...)

Question follow-up:

1. Can we restore 1GHz operation ?  I ask if there is a property or
strategy here to force 1GHz maximum operation unless the user decides
for exceeding the hardware default 0.9V ?
