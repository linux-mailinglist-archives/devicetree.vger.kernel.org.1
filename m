Hi Andre,

some nice talk here, actually the following is just opinions, I will
be likely happy with whatever approach is taken eventually.

the pins in this example are called PB0 and PB1 though. The designation
on the package. And often pins actually named "i2c0_1" "i2c0_2" are
for that primary function, but muxable to a few other functions,
at least GPIO in most cases. So it's just some name for the pin
really.

You have a point, and when working with a system the application
engineer often finds bugs in the pin control driver, and has to go
and fix the actual driver and then all the information hiding and
simplification is moot.

This can become an expensive lesson for the current attempts
to push pin control into firmware where the configuration is
mostly "dead simple" (and just using strings) - the bugs will be
in the firmware instead, and impossible or really hard to fix.

Yeah the ambition with the strings was to avoid forcing application
engineers to know all about that. If they do, they are then
developing the driver, not just using it.

That's what STM32 does as well and it's usable.

But of course it drives a truck through the initial ambition that pins
on all systems be configured the same way, with strings. So now
there are some families of drivers all "necessarily different" which
is not so nice for people jumping between different SoCs, but
very compelling for people focusing on just one SoC.

Well, unless this way of doing things becomes so prevalent that
it's the new black.

And a new standard, to add to the other standards, so that
is my problem as maintainer. It makes sense on its own, and it
complicates the bigger picture.

That's true.

This comes from the DT ambition to describe hardware and config,
but not *define* hardware, i.e. to stop device tree to turn into
Verilog or SystemC, which is what will happen if we take the
1:1 reflection of hardware to device tree too far.

I don't think anyone really knows where to cut the line.

This is a generic problem though, look at GPU drivers.

The community (especially Android) seem set on fixing this by using
modules.

I like this argument the best.

However this also reads "upfront firmware to handle pin control is a
dead end" yet there are people dedicatedly working on exactly that.
(Not that its' the Allwinner developers' problem...)

So i2c0 is SDA and i2c1 is SCL or something?
It seems common, but yeah it can be confusing.
