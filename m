Right.  I don't see that they provide any advantage, so it's just
extra complexity.  I'm open to persuasion if it turns out there's a
concrete reason for it.

This seems reasonable to me.  The fact that these properties are
considered tied to a specific node or property should be stated
explicitly in the general description of "ignorable" tags, though.  As
Herve pointed out, we still have the option of adding more "old style"
tags if we need something that doesn't fit the new constraints.

Not if you rely on reading phandle values.

I don't think it was thought out in that much detail at the time, but
that seems a reasonable approach to me.
