Right. Looking at the mail from Krzysztof, I suspect he meant to
completely document and explain the rcpu prcm, not all of the prcms (he
couldn't really know they existed, based on your v1, right?).
I'd suggest you drop the !rcpu stuff for now, and submit it when you
have the driver for them ready to go. That's typically what's done to
avoid introducing bindings that need to be changed once the driver
actually turns up, since as you say you've not actually tested the
driver for those prcms.

If you think it is going to be confusing, then move the bits common to
!rcpu and rcpu prcms to a file, with the unique bits in dedicated files
perhaps? It seems like they'd be fairly different even with your current
scheme and keeping them apart would aid readability of the driver in
either case?
You can do this extraction as part of adding the !rcpu code, that
doesn't need to be done for the rcpu stuff since the concept of "common"
wouldn't exist in upstream until the !rcpu stuff arrives.

Cheers,
Conor.
