On second thought, I'd agree that having the additional "extended"
.dtb files, i.e. the versions with the DT overlays already applied,
could be quite useful.  It's just that having them built and installed
as well possibly makes everything a bit more convoluted, maybe even
a bit confusing, but that's pretty much inevitable.  However, the
benefits should outweigh those slight downsides.

Regarding the naming, I don't think that prepending a self-descriptive
prefix would actually work as expected, because of the way "magic"
in scripts/Makefile.dtbs works.  Actually, I just tested that, and
it didn't seem to work as expected.

I fully agree with getting away from the tests depending on the
CONFIG_OF_ALL_DTBS configuration option, which I wasn't happy with
from the very beginning of this discussion.  It just felt and still
feels wrong, especially because CONFIG_OF_ALL_DTBS depends on other
configuration option(s) that pretty much don't go together with a
non-development kernel build.

The above-provided example is perfectly fine with me, and it follows
the way "magic" in scripts/Makefile.dtbs works.  I just tested it,
to make sure it works as expected, which it does.  As a note, I like
that the already present .dtbo lines remain unmoved, because that
keeps the DT overlay tests separate from the "meat" of the Makefile,
which should make it more readable and less error-prone.
