I assume usbcon, so old usbdrd, is the second DWC3's phy, just like qcom
qmpphy.

No, not necessarily. If USBCON is entirely different device than USBDRD
(different register layout, different features), then go ahead with a
new binding.

I was questioning your chain of PHYs and this should be investigated.
