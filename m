This is a really minor point, but I don't especially like the term
"metadata" for the symbol / fixup information.  Although it's
technically accurate that it's metadata for the property bytestrings,
in most contexts "metadata" makes me think only of tree global
metadata.  By analogy, symbols and fixup information in a .so or .a
could be seen as metadata to the raw code / data bytes, but I wouldn't
normally use that term for it (whereas I might for, say, the soname or
certain .note sections).

As noted elsewhere, I'm not necessarily opposed to having a general
length encoding.  However, for each new tag I think we need to think
carefully about whether it really is safe for older software that
doesn't understand it to just skip it.

I'd prefer to avoid an additional layer of nesting here - I'd rather
just have multiple top level tags.

That's a perfect example of a new tag that absolutely cannot be just
skipped if not understood.  Software *must* hard error if they
encounter this and don't understand it.
