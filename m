Agreed.  This smells like extend_name and that caused all sorts
of annoying problems for the userspace folk.

Have to be careful we don't run out of space for events.
#define IIO_EVENT_CODE_EXTRACT_CHAN(mask) ((__s16)(mask & 0xFFFF))
So we do have 16 bits hence this might work.

I'm not sure we want to make rules around this though.
