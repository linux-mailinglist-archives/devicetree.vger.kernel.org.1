I don't follow.

ep->page_size is used by pci_epc_multi_mem_init(), pci_epc_mem_alloc_addr()
and pci_epc_mem_free_addr(), so it is used by EPC core.

pci_epc_mem_alloc_addr() currently uses it to align up an allocation to the
page size, so that an allocation from the PCI window/memory space is a multiple
of page_size. How can we avoid exposing the page size to EPC core?


For a DWC-based driver, the mapping part requires that the start address of
the mapping should be aligned to the page size.

But e.g.
drivers/pci/controller/pcie-rockchip-ep.c, sets page size (smallest allocation):
to 1 MB:
windows[i].page_size = SZ_1M;

But the mapping part for rockchip-ep appears to have different requirements.

Sounds good.

Well, dw_pcie_ep_raise_msi_irq() and dw_pcie_ep_raise_msix_irq() currently does
some clearing of lower bits of the address before using .map_addr() to map the
an aligned outbound address. It will then write to the mapped address + some
offset.

Since it is already using .map_addr(), it seems like the perfect use case for
pci_epc_map_align(), as the function then would not need to do any clearing
of lower bits before mapping, nor writing to an offset within the mapping.

It would just use pci_epc_map_align() and then write to map->pci_addr.

+1 on renaming it to bar_alignment or inbound_alignment or similar.

I don't think that we can remove it from epc_features. It is used by
pci_epf_alloc_space() which uses epc_features->align to ensure that
when an EPF driver allocates the backing memory for a BAR, the backing
memory is aligned to bar_alignment. (An allocation of size X is guaranteed
to be aligned to X.)

I think we are saying the same thing.
But in order to remove all .alignment uses in drivers/misc/pci_endpoint_test.c,
we will need to add modify the corresponding EPC driver to either:
- Define the ep->page_size, so that the generic map_align() implementation will
work.
(If you grep for page_size in drivers/pci/controller, you will see that
very few EPC drivers currently set ep->page_size, even though the PCI device
and vendor IDs for those same controllers have specified an alignment in
drivers/misc/pci_endpoint_test.c)
- Define a custom map_align() implementation.

Perhaps it would be nice to have 5) implemented for this initial series,
so that it is possible to test that this new API is behaving as intended?


Kind regards,
