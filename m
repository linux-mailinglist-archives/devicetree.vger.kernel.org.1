That and there's a non-PCI one.

Okay, I guess they happen to be similar. It depends on the host bridge, 
but often the PCI addresses are arbitrary. Often platforms just reuse 
the CPU address, but really they are independent.

Okay, your size is off. For 0xe2000000, you have 0x2000_0000 rather than 
0x0200_0000. (It would be good if this mistake triggered a warning)

Okay, if the h/w is like that, then I agree.

Extending the existing tests is fine. If you can make the non-PCI one 
fail, that would be better as it doesn't depend on the QEMU PCI test 
device.
