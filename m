The whole need for refcounting DRM bridges exists if such bridges can be
removed when other parts of the kernel still have a pointer (=3D a referenc=
e)
to them. This is not the case with current DRM because you cannot remove
some bridges without removing the whole pipeline (card). However I am
working since a long time to suppor hardware where the last part of the
display pipeline is hot-pluggable, causing DRM bridges to be added and
removed at runtime without removal of the initial part of the pipeline
(CRCT, encoder and 0 or more bridges).

See these links for more background info:

 * ELCE 2025:

   - https://bootlin.com/pub/conferences/2025/elce/ceresoli-hotplug-status.=
pdf
 * Lots of links in the slides about previous activity
 * LPC 2024 has a general description fo the use case:

Perhaps there is some possible UAF on probe errors or deferrals, but the
typical case is when removing the final part of a pipeline, including 1+
bridges. This was discussed in detail in [0], but here's an excerpt with
the typical UAF scenario with hotplug:

  1. pipeline: encoder --> bridge A --> bridge B --> bridge C
  2. encoder takes a reference to bridge B
     using devm_drm_of_find_bridge() or other means
  3. bridge B takes a next_bridge reference to bridge C
     using devm_drm_of_find_bridge()
  4. encoder calls (bridge B)->foo(), which in turns references
     next_bridge, e.g.:

       b_foo() {
           bar(b->next_bridge);
       }

If bridges B and C are removed, bridge C can be freed but B is still
allocated because the encoder holds a ref. So when step 4 happens, 'b->c'
would be a use-after-free (or NULL deref if b.remove cleared it, which is
just as bad).

Exactly. The idea in a nutshell is: every pointer to a drm_bridge stored
somewhere is a reference to a bridge. So:

 * When you take a reference (=3D you set a pointer to the address of a
   bridge) you need to call drm_bridge_get() to increment the
   refcount.
 * When you clear a reference (set it to NULL) or the pointer becomes
   unreachable (the device goes away, the struct holding it is not
   reachable anymore, etc) you need to call drm_bridge_put() to decrement
   the refcount.

This way the struct drm_bridge (or, typically, the private driver struct
embedding it) will be freed only when the refcount goes to 0, avoiding UAF.

I have been converting most of the accessors returning a drm_bridge pointer
in order to drm_bridge_get() the bridge before returning it. A few random
examples:

 - https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250620-drm-bridge-alloc-getput-drm-bridge=
-c-v9-0-ca53372c9a84@bootlin.com/

d_bridge-2-v2-4-8bad3ef90b9f@bootlin.com/

I hope this clarifies the general refcount topic. Now to *_of_get_bridge().

The issue with devm_drm_of_get_bridge(MYDEV, ...) (similarly for other
*_of_get_bridge() functions) is it can return one of:

 A) an existing bridge, returned by drm_of_find_panel_or_bridge() in the
    &bridge parameter
 B) a panel_bridge it creates on the fly calling
    devm_drm_panel_bridge_add(MYDEV) based on the panel returned by
    drm_of_find_panel_or_bridge() in the &panel parameter

The caller of devm_drm_of_get_bridge() gets a drm_bridge pointer but
doesn't know whether case A or B happened.

This is not a problem if the entire card is torn down at once because
devm/drmm will take care or the removal. Even easier if the card is not
torn down at all.

Now imagine adding hotplug so you can keep MYDEV present but remove any
bridges after MYDEV and the panel. The devm action added by
devm_drm_of_get_bridge() won't trigger (because MYDEV is not going
away). The caller of devm_drm_of_get_bridge(), i.e. the MYDEV driver,
should remove the panel_bridge in case B but it has no way to know whether
case A or B happened.

So, this is tricky. The good news for you is you're not supposed to fix
it. The *_of_get_bridge() API is just unable to handle hotplug, that will
be fixed at some point. For now just ensure you get a reference for every
bridge pointer you store, and to put it when that reference goes away.

>> How can I trigger the
>> issue?

See the example above.

>> Why is bridge hotplug required at this stage?

Because there is hot-pluggable hardware we want to support, see the ELCE
and even better the LPC links above.

>> Why is only this
>> bridge affecte by the hotplug issue?

It's not only this driver. Hotplug can potentially be used on any hardware,
so I'm working to implement it in a general way in the DRM common code, but
all drviers need to at least do the refcounting on their side. I'm trying
to catch all patches involving bridge pointers and check whether they do
refcounting right. This is just one of many patches I have commented about
in the past months.

I hope this clarified a bit.

Best regards,
Luca
