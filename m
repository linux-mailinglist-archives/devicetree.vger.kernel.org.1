You never said that in your patch description. You said "it causes
link instability and communication failures." Have you investigated
what the cause of the interrupt storm is?

You claim this commit enables EEE by default. It does. However, stmmac
_before_ this commit enables EEE by default as I've already explained,
quoting the old code which effects this. I've asked you to test
further. So far, I've heard nothing back.

What has changed is that we no longer do anything with the RGSMIIS
status, and in theory keep the mask/enable for this disabled. Howeer,
that is a subsequent commit.
