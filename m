Regarding this, I could use some advice. Bjorn I tagged you in because 
you're probably best to have an opinion here.

Learned a few things from that note. Seems ioremap is just giving us a 
KSEG1 address and virt_to_phys() is getting the real address back. In 
any case I'm just doing what the driver already does.

There aren't any.

Okay here's the one I have a question about:

There's a bunch of related issues here, and I don't see any way to 
perfectly resolve all of them without moving retrain up before 
pci_host_probe(), but as noted previously without a mapped bus I can't 
just call pcie_retrain_link() and I have to - at worst - manually find 
the registers which is an annoying amount of additional code.

 From the vendor code, it looks like it should be about 50-70 lines of 
code to do this manually. The question is, is this race adding more 
complexity than that code?

I think wrapping the mtk_pcie_retrain() call in a 
pci_lock_rescan_remove() lock should stop any downstream probing while 
pcie_retrain_link() sleeps, but if it happens that a downstream device 
ends up probing on a different CPU, in the moment 
between pci_host_probe() and pci_lock_rescan_remove(), we still have the 
problem of retraining while the device is setting up. Though this is 
admittedly a pretty tiny race window.

So I think the options are:

1. Do nothing

2. Add pci_lock_rescan_remove() - I'm not informed enough to know if 
this can introduce other issues...

3. Give up on using pcie_retrain_link() and do it manually before 
pci_host_probe()


I'm leaning toward #2 but I also don't know what I don't know, so I 
could use a little advice.

Handled in the if statement above, noted in previous version of the patch.

Issue noted above.
