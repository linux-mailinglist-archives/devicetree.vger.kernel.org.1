Sorry for coming very late on this.

This series is intended to handle coresight components which resides within CPU cluster.
For the cases where cluster is in deepest idle low power mode or all CPUs belonging to cluster
are hotplugged off, access to coresight components can not be done.

The implementation tried to address in two parts,
1. Using cluster power-domain to know which coresight component belongs to which cluster/CPUs
2. Schedule the task on intended cluster's CPU to make sure the CPU (and cluster) power is
ON while coresight component of the cluster is being accessed (using smp_call_function_single()).

The use of power-domains in (1) will limit this to PSCI OS-Initiated mode,
to have this support on PSCI Platform-Coordinated mode too, probably instead of power-domains,
cpu-maps (which also defines the clusters) from device tree is a better choice which will give
the information on which CPU belongs to which cluster.

(2) ensured that scheduling happened on intended CPU and while the access is in progress, CPU (and
cluster) will not enter power down in between.

Yes, This is to ensure that CPU (and cluster) power is ON while coresight components
for same cluster are being accessed.

Cluster power-domains will be only available for PSCI OS-initiated mode but also
will not help for cases where all CPUs in cluster are hotplugged off as hotplugs are
platform coordinated.

After discussion with our HW team to automatically request power on for coresight
component GPR [1] can be used but they seems not working as intended on the existing
SoCs and will be available on next generation SoC.

please see below comment for more details, This seems not a firmware issue.

+ Ulf in loop.

Current platforms with OSI enabled, Linux PSCI do not implement the power_on/power_off
requests, as far as i know, runtime PM was never meant to implement this part and
pm_runtime_get_sync() (from drivers/cpuidle/cpuidle-psci.c) call is only used to convey
to cluster power domains about a child CPU/ sub domain being on after it has already
been landed in Linux.

The standalone invoke of pm_runtime_get_sync() from another CPU do not really turn on/get
the CPU (and cluster), as the CPUs either use CPUidle / CPU hotplug paths to enter/exit
low power mode.

To put it other way,
For a hot-plugged off CPU, invoking a pm_runtime_get_sync() won't get the CPU (and make
its cluster power domain) ON. In order to turn on the CPU, one has to still request
the online of the CPU, say via sysfs command echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/online
which would invoke PSCI CPU_ON function and the power domain for CPU gets marked as ON
only after CPU already landed in Linux via psci_idle_cpuhp_up() invoking pm_runtime_get_sync().

I used specific hotplug example but same applies to idle powered down CPU (or Cluster) too.
