The instance numbers do not always match the unit address sorting.

For example K3 SoCs have:

dts/src/arm64/ti/k3-am62-main.dtsi:548: sdhci0: mmc@fa10000 {
dts/src/arm64/ti/k3-am62-main.dtsi:566: sdhci1: mmc@fa00000 {
dts/src/arm64/ti/k3-am62-main.dtsi:589: sdhci2: mmc@fa20000 {

Rockchip:

dts/src/arm64/rockchip/rk356x-base.dtsi:619:    sdmmc2: mmc@fe000000 {
dts/src/arm64/rockchip/rk356x-base.dtsi:994:    sdmmc0: mmc@fe2b0000 {
dts/src/arm64/rockchip/rk356x-base.dtsi:1008:   sdmmc1: mmc@fe2c0000 {

There are some examples for i.MX as well. To my own surprise not with
the mmc nodes, but some SPI instances are not sorted by unit address.

What do you consider fragile with it?
