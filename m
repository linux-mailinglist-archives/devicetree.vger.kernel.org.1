Yeah that would probably give the best end result. I was thinking that ptep/pXdp
might reduce churn since we already use it in function names. Stack pointers are
definitely a small minority so easier to change their convention.

But having an explicit "hw" would probably be best.

sounds good. Or hw_pte_t? Then "pte_t" is still greppable and it better matches
the hw_pte_get() that you have below.

My aim was to have a type that you can't dereference, can't accidentally pass as
a pte_t* and also can't increment/decrement/index.

This gives us a framework where the architecture can completely virtualize the
pgtable if it likes; and the compiler can enforce that higher level code can't
accidentally work around it.

I have a couple of use cases where these properties will come in handy; arm64
now defines 128-bit pgtables. We have a prototype adding it to the kernel, but
at the moment it has to be a compile time descision so that all the generic code
knows the size of the entries. It would be preferable to make it a boot time
decision, based on the HW capabilities (or cmdline, ...). But for that, we need
to better insulate the physical pgtables from the core-mm. This concept solves that.

I _think_ that works for the above, and it is certainly nicer.

pte_hw_t pte_table = pte_alloc(...);
for (i = 0; i < PTRS_PER_PTE; i++)
	hw_pte_get(pte_table[i]);

I think that would fail to compile, right? Which is what we want. Instead we
need something like:

pte_hw_t hwpte = pte_alloc(...);
for (i = 0; i < PTRS_PER_PTE; i++, hwpte = hw_pte_next(hwpte))
	hw_pte_get(hwpte);

What's the problem with it?

I'm not sure... sounds to me like we would need to convert absolutely everything
including arches that are difficult for most people to test. With the "typedef
pte_t *hw_pte_t;" approach, you can go bit-by-bit and leave those unloved arches
alone entirely.

I think the requirements are basically this:

"_ONCE" gives 2 properties; single-copy-atomicity and compiler can't move/remove
instructions.

SCA is important to prevent tearing if the HW can update the PTE concurrently
with SW reading it (i.e. HW access/dirty) or if SW is reading without holding
the PTL. But there are times when it doesn't matter if the PTE gets torn because
you are only comparing the result using pte_none() or pte_same().

The "compiler can't move/remove" property (I'm sure there is a formal name for
this?) is important for lockless walkers. Probably you could achieve similar
results by using barrier()?

No; you should never use the accessor methods for sw entries - they are just
variables - read them normally. If all HW accesses use "once", then the compiler
can't optimize away the accesses for the folded pgtable case.

Yes exactly that.

I think it would work but it's going to be a lot of churn. But if you think it's
worth it and we'll be able to get it in, then I'm up for working on it in the
background.
