Let me see if I can hack something up on this board (which has a decent
dependency tree for testing this stuff) to use the generic phy driver
instead of the marvell one that it needs and see how that goes. It won't
*actually* work from a phy perspective, but it will at least test out
the driver core bits here I think.

Sure, I tend to agree. Let me check the generic phy driver path for any
issues and if that test seems to go okay I too am of the opinion that
without any solid reasoning against this we enable it and battle through
(revert and fix after the fact if necessary) any newly identified issues
that prevent phy-handle and fw_devlink have with each other.
