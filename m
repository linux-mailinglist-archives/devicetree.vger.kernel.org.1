Personally, I'm all for letting the kernel build the DTBs with symbols.

(I have a patch that I keep rebasing on my tree only for that purpose.
Sure, I could modify my build scripts to build the DTB separately,
but with this patch, I do not need to do anything since the kernel
builds the DTBs already.)

Other platforms, e.g. TI already build many boards with symbols:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.13/arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/Makefile#L242-L261


You seems to have been against enabling symbols before:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-rockchip/171941553475.921128.9467465539299233735.b4-ty@sntech.de/
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-rockchip/1952472.6tgchFWduM@diego/

But if you have changed you mind, and you are no longer concerned about
doing so, then in my own self-interest I'm all for it :)


Kind regards,
Niklas
