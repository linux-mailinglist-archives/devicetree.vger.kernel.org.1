Hello Conor,

Thanks for the comment -- as this binding was created, it was noted that 
it is somewhat of an oddball compared to existing bindings, so rationale
should have been provided somewhere, to justify whether those oddities
are needed because of this hardware being odd, or whether I was going
out of bounds. Would that have belonged in the initial patch series
message?

My rationale was this -- as has been mentioned by others, the i2c node
seems to be normalized as a separated submode because it does represent
a distinct bus, and it make sense to group the devices on that bus such
that the context of `reg` is aparrent (i.e. if there were multiple i2c
busses, they would necessarily need their own nodes). Initially when
creating this binding, I applied the same logic to the gpio chip,
observing the presence of the "hog" child nodes, and that their `gpios`
property also acts like `reg` on a bus, relating to the parent node.
But, now, seeing that that is already something that has been ruled not
to be the case, it makes sense to me why i2c busses might need their own
nodes while gpio chips might not.

Thanks,

Danny Kaehn
