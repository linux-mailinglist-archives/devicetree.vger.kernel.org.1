OK, I will put in 2023, as this is when I touched this again.

Just for the records, and for my own reference:
Since there is no "ranges" property in the MMC node, the Linux platform 
bus driver is not automatically traversing any child nodes. So we don't 
need a compatible string. Instead it's a new addressing scheme (this 
obsolete MMC "bus" address, like SPI or I2C), so it's up to the driver 
to do the child iteration. And it will match device #1 to reg <1>, and 
use that node, as Chen-Yu mentioned.

But this is a Linux implementation detail, which we should not rely on 
in a DT? And if I remember Maxime correctly back then, the plan was to 
avoid those driver hacks and just say what we support in the DT, going 
forward. This might be needed for other OSes, which might not support 
HS-200?

But this is also a limitation of the current Linux kernel driver. And 
since we indeed don't support HS-400, we explicitly remove it from the 
capability list, *after* the call to mmc_of_parse():

drivers/mmc/host/sunxi-mmc.c:1460
         /* TODO: This driver doesn't support HS400 mode yet */
         mmc->caps2 &= ~MMC_CAP2_HS400;

So I think this should be safe?

Andre
