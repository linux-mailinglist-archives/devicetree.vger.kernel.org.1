I didn't have time last night to properly read your proposal - certainly
not to go back to your original post, but from what I did read in your
follow up, it seemed that you were proposing that e.g. the SoC level
should be in binary form.

The confusion came from "build a "base" device tree" which implied to
me taking the e.g. SoC .dtsi and turning that into its binary form.

Sorry for misunderstanding.
