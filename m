This isn't a thing, or do you plan to add nexus nodes / map bindings for all possible
enumerated items in DT? Not sure this will scale well :/

What is this node? I'm assuming this is something the "connector driver" for
this connector will look for and populate subnodes? What about simple connectors
where no driver should be needed?

What if this I2C instance is not enabled (maybe not an issue for I2C,
but some devices should have their status left disabled unless something
is connected, SPI for instance).

And this (I2C) only works because there is this `i2c-parent` thing, but that
isn't the case for most (e.g. there is no spi-parent, mdio-parent, etc..)
My proposal[0] handles that by giving standard names to the provider phandles
that conforming add-on board overlays can reference directly.

*How* is this "applied at the addon-connector0 node"?

Again I'm going to guess this is if we are able to modify the `fdtapply` tool
to accept connection points as a new command line parameter. And then somehow
do the same for all other projects that apply DT overlays (U-Boot, Zephyr, etc.).

And in that case, we would have to pass in the name of the connector anyway,
so having that name be the only item in `export-symbols` doesn't get us anything
new, we could have just passed the connector name directly.

BTW, this is solved in my proposal[0] with adapter/shim overlays. Which allow for
this to work without any modifying the overlay tooling. Maybe there is a way we
can put this new `export-symbols` node in the adapter overlay to avoid passing
in the connector name directly to the tooling.. I have to think on this.

Is this really a fixed regulator on the add-on board or is this being feed
from the main board's PMIC but you have no good way to model that connection
with this scheme? This breaks the regulator/power dependency graph. If a
device on the add-on board powers down, that information is no longer sent
back to the parent PMIC and the power rail will be needlessly left enabled.

This is why I was looking for a full complete example, not a simplified one.
I'm having to make too many assumptions here to give this `export-symbols`
thing a proper review.
