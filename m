Known to us, sure, know to old kernel (or other software), not so much.
For this sort of driver the main use of fallback compatibles is to work on
a not yet aware kernel.

Taking a rather extreme viewpoint: So fallback compatibles are pointless why do
we bother with them?  Note this ID register thing covers most IIO drivers that
have fallback compatibles today. This is not a rare corner case.

Sure, but as above, that breaks the use of fallback compatibles for the incredibly
common case of otherwise identical parts that would work fine on an old kernel
but where we can't match them because the ID register differs.
