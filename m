Thank you for this information, it makes much more easier to see the big picture.
With the given information I think you most likely need a brand new driver.
No callbacks for sure. The only thing that may be done is to split really common
code and data structures in i2c-designware-lib.[ch] between two. This will
require quite a bit of refactoring (as you most likely don't want to inherit
all quirked and hacked fields from struct dw_i2c_dev, meaning you want to
have something just very basic and common between two there. means that
the current struct dw_i2c_dev will be morphed to something like

drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-designware-lib.h:

	struct dw_i2c_common {
		...
	};

drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-designware-core.h:

	struct dw_i2c_dev {
		struct dw_i2c_common icom;
		...
	};

and in your new driver

	struct dw_adv_i2c_dev {
		struct dw_i2c_common icom;
		...
	};

And in the drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-designware-lib.c:

	... dw_i2c_common_...(struct dw_i2c_common *icom, ...)
	{
		...
	}

for the shared APIs.

With that I predict a series out of ~10 patches (or more).

The brand new driver is also a solution, but to go there you need to at least
have a PoC of the above to justify that the shared code makes little sense.
