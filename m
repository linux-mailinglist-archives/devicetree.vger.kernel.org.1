I think you're still thinking that ethernet PHYs and generic PHYs are
the same, but only differ in e.g. whether .set_mode() is populated.
This is completely wrong.

Ethernet PHYs are _completely_ separate from Generic PHYs. Forget the
"PHY" bit, that's totally irrelevant that they happen to be called
the same. The two classes share _no_ common infrastructure in the
kernel.

Ethernet PHYs can't have phy_set_mode_ext() called on them, because
ethernet PHYs have no "struct phy" associated with them. They also
can't have phy_power_on() either for the same reason, nor any of the
other generic PHY API calls.

Ethernet PHYs aren't a sub-class of generic PHYs. As I said,
Ethernet PHYs and generic PHYs are two entirely separate and different
subsystems with no commonality.

So... the commit message states "generic PHY". It states the generic
PHY API calls of phy_set_mode_ext() and phy_power_up(). From that we
deduce that bp->phy is a generic PHY. Thus, the commit message is
talking about generic PHYs not ethernet PHYs.

Ethernet PHYs are described in Ethernet controller DT using the
"phy-handle" property (and previously "phy" or "phy-device"

Generic PHYs are described using the "phys" property.

The presence of an ethernet-phy node in DT does not automatically
associate that device with anything - it has to be referenced by
a "phy-handle" property to connect it to an Ethernet controller.

However, as I've been trying to point out, as this commit is about
generic PHYs, Ethernet PHYs are just not relevant to this commit.
