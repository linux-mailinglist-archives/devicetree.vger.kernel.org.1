IMHO silently removing the support will break designs for sure and
should never be done. As said, imagine that the firmware will handle the
supplies and the driver only needs to release the reset. If you silently
remove the support, the device will be kept in reset-state. In field
firmware updates are seldom, so you break your device by updating to a
new kernel.

One could argue that the driver supported it but there was no dt-binding
yet, so it was a hidden/unstable feature but I don't know the policy.
