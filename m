So, it's not a DW per se? What the DW databook reflects the register layout and
other bits? I.o.w. which version of DW i2c IP is this?

This can be done in the custom regmap functions. You know that you may
redefine the regmap IO accessors and do whatever you want there based on
the registers. Yes, what you are probably talking about is a workflow.

But we basically need to see a patch-per-workflow change for each case
to understand the differences better. I.o.w. if you need, for instance,
separate or special IRQ handling part, create a patch to move existing
code to a callback with explanation why it's needed. All the same for
the timings and so on. It would be nice to have a datasheet at hand to
actually read and see the differences. Without that it's even hard to
propose better solutions. But current state is for sure no go.

This feature should be left at last, but altogether it smells like either
a completely new i2c DW design (like they did for DMA and SSI at some
point) and most likely will need a brand new driver explaining all of this
with a link to a datasheet.

These sounds like candidates for i2c-designware-lib.c, indeed.
But the rest most likely shouldn't be intervened at all. I.o.w.
please provide a detailed analysis (something like [1]) in
the cover letter, or just send an RFC on the driver design
before even starting considering actual coding.
