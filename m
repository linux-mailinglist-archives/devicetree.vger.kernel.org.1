I mostly agree.  But as noted, we can't advertise v18 (or whatever)
support until we actually *do* support it - which would imply having
some docs / specs on what exactly is in v18.  So the series will need
some re-ordering to allow pieces to be merged earlier.

Good point, and dtb has heavier than many need of true 64-bit ints.
It's a real half-ton of flies in a mostly pretty decent data model :(.

ASN.1? CBOR? Messagepack? Protobuf?  I don't love any of those, but
I'm not sure they'd be *more* clunky than something we cobble together
on top of dtb.

As a rule, I also prefer evolution to revolution.  But there can come
a point where you're straining the thing you're building on further
than makes sense any more.

I guess it depends a bit how you're thinking of this type information.
Are you thinking of it as an intrinsic part of the dtb information
that a consumer (like the kernel) would use?  Something akin to the
symbols or relocation information in an ELF object.

Or are you thinking of it as something for the benefit of intermediate
tools, that could be stripped out before going to the final consumer?
Something like debug symbols in an ELF object.

I'm open to the second approach, although I'm still a bit concerned
that once it's there as "debug" information things might start relying
on it which shouldn't.
