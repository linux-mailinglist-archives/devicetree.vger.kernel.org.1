Agreed. Reviewed-by doesn't apply.

This is not different than Coverity, Smatch, syzbot or any other robots (*).

(*) except for the ones that report actual build failures after trying
    to compile the Kernel.

So far, I got just one report from sashiko-bot on a patch series
I wrote for linux-doc. It did get some issues, but it also had false 
positives and it was too verbose for my taste, trying to explain
me why I wrote patches or why I did some changes, and writing 9
patch replies to a 13-patch series.

Even as a developer, I would expect a much cleaner output - and
with my maintainer's hat, just a single e-mail briefly giving
a summary of issues detected at the patch series as a hole
(e.g. just one short e-mail).

I disagree. The earliest an issue is reported/fixed, the better.

As a maintainer, I do want that patch developers take reports from 
any bots into account, no matter what technology they use or if
the bot is sponsored by someone or not. Sure, open-source tools
are preferred, but we should not close our eyes to issues,
specially if they can end adding vulnerabilities at the Kernel if
the patches end being applied.

With that in mind, even if LLMs are giving just 20-30% accuracy
of a reviewer, but it has high accuracy picking security issues
that would otherwise be exploited by some LLM tool, I'd say it is
valuable enough.

That said, for LLM tools, I'd say that the report to maintainers/ML
need to be very short:

- What problems a patch series may have in terms of security
  (OOM? privilege escalation? ...);
- What major issues a patch series may have;
- Other medium issues(*).

(*) Issues that are already reported by bots like LKP shall not
    be reported from LLMs to maintainers, as we want to minimize
    duplicated information sent to maintainers as much as possible,
    and LLMs don't replace code compilers nor tools like checkpatch,
    which are more specialized.


Thanks,
Mauro
