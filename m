Yes that is correct, I am not sure why this was left out in the initial
implementation of the gems maybe others can give some insight. The gems
can, similar to the emacs, take an external or internal ref clock that
is decided by the usrio registers. The difference with the gems and the
emacs is the gems can have 125MHz refclk for RGMII (50Mhz for RMII)
either internal or external where as the emacs can only switch refclk
for RMII.

Since a dt string would need to be placed either way could the default
be setting be 1 like how the emacs is set then make a
"microchip,refclk-internal" flag, this seems to have the minimal amount
of conflicts with legacy implementation.

So to leave the "USRIO_HAS_CLKEN" caps flag in the existing configs for
emacs, then have this be a toggle for the gem configs, and the
"microchip/cdns,refclk-source" would be parsed to either set this bit to
1 or 0? The USRIO refclk bit will be set in the macb_init() based on if
the dt property is there rather than how it is currently implemented now
if I understand correctly?
