For i2c, I first need to implement the i2c bus extensions [0]. Something 
similar for SPI, UART, etc. Somewhat long list of things.

Once I make the connector node a gpio and pwm nexus node, it will not be 
specific to just one host board. But yes, the current one is like that.

No, it cannot be. When using `__symbols__`, the changes are not 
contained to a single devicetree nodes. As you can see even in the 
current form of the overlay, any modifications happen inside the 
connector node. Nothing outside of the connector node is modified at 
runtime.

I am not here to argue whether runtime global devicetree manipulation is 
an okay thing to do. I would be fine with it if upstream is okay with 
it. But neither sysfs based, nor configfs based patches for dynamic 
devicetree are being considered for that exact reason.

I am working from the assumption that upstream will not accept a global 
devicetree manipulation solution. So for local node based solution, 
export-symbols are essential. If I misunderstood something in this very 
basic assumption, then feel free to correct me.

Do note, that any solution cannot just stay as a static, apply using 
fdtoverlay kind of thing. It needs to allow for dynamic discovery using 
both EEPROM or something similar, and a fallback using sysfs or configfs.
