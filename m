I'm not sure yet :(  It's a pretty complex design and we haven't really com=
e to a conclusion
on how to handle this channel 'mixing' case.

If we did go this way, we'd need to figure out a way to describe the mixing=
 part.
So either we describe it as one channel (which is going to be really comple=
x)
or we describe it as multiple channels but add extra ABI to make it clear t=
hey
are mixed into a single 'physical' channel.
