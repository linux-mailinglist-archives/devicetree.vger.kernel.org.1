Even if there are PERST# GPIOs from the host, connected to downstream ports of a
PCIe switch, they could be stored in the Root Port's (pci_host_port) struct as a
list of PERST#. This is what pcie-qcom driver does.

It is too clumsy to handle PERST# individually for each device. We tried it
before with pwrctrl, but it always ended up biting us on who gets to control the
PERST#. We can't let pwrctrl handle PERST# for a switch port and host controller
driver handle it for RP. And we cannot let pwrctrl handle PERST# for all ports,
because, host controller drivers also need to control them for RC
initialization.

That's why it was decided to handle PERST# for all ports in the host controller
drivers. So following that pattern, this helper could also be extended to parse
the PERST# from all ports defined in DT and store them in the same Root Port
struct.

It should be trivial to implement this logic in the current helper. @Sherry:
Could you please implement this logic?

Problem is, PERST# needs to be controlled even before 'pci_dev' gets created. We
create 'pci_dev' only when a device get's detected. But the PERST# assertion and
deassertion happens even before the pci_host_probe() call, which is the starting
point for enumeration. That's why storing it as a list in 'pci_host_bridge'
makes it accessible by the host controller drivers.

AFAIK, a single device can have only one WAKE# irrespective of how many function
it exposes. PCIe base spec doesn't indicate whether it is per-device or
per-function, but the form factor specfications like CEM, Mini-CEM define it as
a per-device signal.

Moreover, unlike PERST#, WAKE# is not driven by the host system. Host just needs
to register an IRQ handler to service the interrupts raised by the device. So it
can be parsed *after* enumerating a device and stored in 'pci_dev' as done in
Krishna's series:
