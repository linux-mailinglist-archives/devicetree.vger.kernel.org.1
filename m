So in the v1 patchset, it was done with just a Mediatek specific heap
with no framework or abstractions for another vendor to build on top
of. The feedback was to make this more generic since Mediatek won't be
the only vendor who wants a restricted heap..which is how it ended up
here. There was more code in the framework before relating to TEE
calls, but then that was moved to the vendor specific code since not
all restricted heaps are allocated through a TEE.

This was also desirable for the V4L2 pieces since there's going to be
a V4L2 flag set when using restricted dma_bufs (and it wants to
validate that)....so in order to keep that more generic, there should
be a higher level concept of restricted dma_bufs that isn't specific
to a single vendor.  One other thing that would ideally come out of
this is a cleaner way to check that a dma_buf is restricted or not.
The current V4L2 patchset just attaches the dma_buf and then checks if
the page table is empty....and if so, it's restricted. But now I see
there's other feedback indicating attaching a restricted dma_buf
shouldn't even be allowed, so we'll need another strategy for
detecting them. Ideally there is some function/macro like
is_dma_buf_restricted(struct dma_buf*) that can indicate that...but we
haven't come up with a good way to do that yet which doesn't involve
adding another field to dma_buf or to dma_buf_ops (and if such a thing
would be fine, then OK...but I had assumed we would get pushback on
modifying either of those structs).
