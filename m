The binding should be complete, if there are interrupts then document
them even if the driver doesn't use them. If this is where you say you
mentioned the io-backends, that's not what I meant - you need to do it
in the patch itself to explain why you have the odd setup with resets
and reset-gpios.
That said, if you don't know what the io-backends stuff is going to look
like for this device, you should probably exclude those resets until the
design for the io-backend IP is complete. reset-gpios are usually
optional anyway (since they are often just wired high/low), so there
shouldn't be any downside there.

btw, the datasheet for this device (rev e) says:
| SYNC_CLK is a rising edge active signal. It is derived from the
| system clock and a divide-by-4 frequency divider. SYNC_CLK,

It's not externally provided, so the third sentence here is confusing.

This property definitely needs justification given that it looks like
the device will just do the right thing without the property.

Honestly, this binding design seems so tightly integrated with the
io-backend that you're shooting yourself in the foot, and making it hard
for us to review, by not including it. I think this really should be a
clock provider and the io-backend a clock consumer, even if it causes a
cyclical dependency. One of the two can probably be a post-init-provider
to the other, probably something like sync_clk doesn't need to be set at
probe, and setting the rate can be delayed until we start needing data
=66rom the device? Since both sync_clk and pdclk are provided by the
ad9910 to the io-backend, your driver will have control over what the
rates of these clocks are and you shouldn't need to hard code the
multipliers etc. You just need to know if the parallel bus is in use or
not. I'm not sure if that's a given if there's an io-backend and you're
not on a serial bus or if would need a property to identify.

Most of the clocking related properties here seem like they go away if
you make the device a clock-controller, for example the driver should be
able to decide if the needs to enable reference-div2 to achieve the
internal frequencies that it needs. sync-clk-disable would be done
automatically if there's no consumer of sync_clk etc.
