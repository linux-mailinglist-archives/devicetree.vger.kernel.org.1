That's what I did, of course:
- there is no order in the compatible strings, not in the most specific
name, nor in the fallback names
- new boards have always been added somewhere in the middle, never at the
end, so it's not "oldest boards first"
- the SoCs used in the boards are all over the place, so it's not sorted
by SoC
- I see no rhyme or reason in the board types: we have tablets, devboards,
TV boxes all mixed up happily.

But: from the 197 listed boards, a movement of 13 boards, often by just one
position, makes the list ordered by description.

So I assumed this was the intention, and fixed the list accordingly. Happy
to stand corrected if the maintainers have a better idea.

Cheers,
Andre
