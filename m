My experience is - and that's probably not surprising as it may tie back to=
 the
relatively limited training set you mention above - that it sometimes loses
context at the FFI boundary, where it has to consider the semantics of the =
C and
the Rust APIs.

I think the difficult part is not necessarily that there is a language boun=
dary
by itself, but rather that it can be difficult for LLMs to capture the sema=
ntic
layer that a Rust API puts on top of a C API in order to derive a safe API.

This also has been my experience in other LLM contexts; the most significan=
t
improvements I saw in output quality have been by providing more semantic
context for the abstraction design.

Probably easy to look up, but does Sashiko consider cover letters already?

I'd say both, and I think the reason is probably the same for both. But to =
be
fair, this is probably also biased by the class of changes I deal with on t=
he C
and on the Rust side too.

It is also fair to say that in Rust we (almost) don't have whole classes of=
 bugs
that we have on the C side; and the class of memory safety issues makes a h=
uge
proportion of bugs on the C side.

If the model is particularly good at finding memory safety issues (and I th=
ink
it is), it of course also messes with the statistics of false positives
comparing C with Rust.

I'm not sure it addresses much of this concern, as I prefer to keep everyon=
e the
patch (series) has been sent to explicitly in the loop.

Of course everyone has a different workflow, but I think it is fair to assu=
me
that most people who are addressed directly follow along through their inbo=
x and
not through the mailing list.

So, I think the real alternative is "reply all", which for multiple reasons=
 I'm
not convinced is the right general call to make yet.

(I do consider it for one of the components I maintain though.)

Thanks,
Danilo
