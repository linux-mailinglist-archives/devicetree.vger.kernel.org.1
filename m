Don't we have already support for that? This changes the picture even more towards
NAKing this. See below why.

TBH, the change sounds to me like a hack. It doesn't cover other potential ways
of the multi-cs devices come into play. Given that SPI core supports multi-cs
I don't see a good justification for this patch.
