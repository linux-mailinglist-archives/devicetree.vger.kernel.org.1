Hi Mark, and everyone,

Thank you for the thoughtful advice, I am currently researching a few
newer boards to order, specifically looking for ones with incomplete
audio support.

For an immediate contribution that I can start on without specific
hardware, I've been digging into the DT bindings and identified a
challenge I'd like to help solve.

While learning to configure audio, I found that discovering the valid
routing strings (simple-audio-card,routing) for a lot of codecs is
kind of difficult. Currently, for most codecs, the only way to find
those is to read the ASoC C driver source for the specific codec. This
seems problematic for a few reasons:

    - It creates a high barrier for developers who are focused on
board bring-up, forcing them to navigate complex C driver code just to
configure a (simple) device tree node.

    - The process is inefficient and error-prone, as typos when
copying strings can lead to audio routes failing silently and being
difficult to debug.

I believe documenting these strings directly in each codec's DT
binding file (.yaml) would be a significant improvement. It would make
the binding self-contained and greatly improve the experience for
anyone setting up audio on a board.

Does this seem like a useful contribution? If you agree, I can get
started immediately on preparing a patch for a popular codec to serve
as an example.

Thanks again for your time,
Jihed
