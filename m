Note this isn't en entirely new situation. As a maintainer, you know how
much you trust each reviewer. You will consider some R-b tags as a sign
you don't even have to look at a patch, and will completely ignore some
others. There's a whole continuum in the middle. In some ways, reviews
by an LLM are similar. You will trust them or not trust them.

Except they're also very different.

The kernel needs more skilled reviewers (I don't think this is a
controversial statement). We can't expect all newcomers to start with
extensive experience from day one, so there's a learning curve. I
believe it's fine for more junior reviewers to send R-b tags even if
they miss some issue, as long as they genuinely try and improve (and, in
some unfortunate cases, decide to leave if patch review turns out not to
be for them). Those R-b tags may feel like a bit of noise in the
beginning, but that's compensated by their value increasing over time.

Bot reviews are not the same. Not only are they generated at a much
larger scale than human reviews, they also won't learn from feedback you
give them. Sure, the tools may be improved when cases of false positives
are identified, and new LLMs may be trained with more (and better ?)
data to improve the output, but they won't learn from the interactions.

How much value a maintainer sees in those reviews is up to individual
maintainers. I will personally not consider a R-b tag from an LLM to
mean that a patch is ready to be merged (and I believe you won't
either). As such, I think that a R-b from an LLM is misleading and
doesn't provide good value. At best it's free advertising for company
making closed-source tools, which I don't think we should encourage.

If some maintainers want LLM reviews and want to act on them, that's
their personal prerogative. They're free to decide on how much value
they see in those reviews, as well as on whether or not they consider
usage of those tools compatible with FOSS ethics. Those are personal
decisions. However, given that the ethical decision is personal, I am
strongly against forcing patch authors to act on automated LLM review.
