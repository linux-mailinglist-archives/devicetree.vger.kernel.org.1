Some of this perhaps should just be cross references to project docs.
Other things that repeat:
- Avoid lists of what isn't supported. They become wrong fast, just list what
  is supported.
- Don't reference driver versions (definitely not RFC ones!) in docs.

Mostly a case of ensuing you have one canonical source for the protocol
docs and that what you have here doesn't become 'wrong' if new features
are added either to the sensor platform, or to the driver - it just becomes
potentially out of date.

I'd argue this is spinning it wrong.  It is the wire format used by the device
implementing your protocol.  Linux is just one "customer".

Again, why Linux specific?  Nothing wrong with starting there, but if this is
successful seems unlikely this will be the only host OS.

I'd talk about the Linux/IIO driver as a reference stack or something like that.

Don't talk about "RFC" in here because that's just text that will become wrong
and might get missed when you move on from RFCs.

Generally I'd avoid adding notes in documentation for what is 'not' supported.
That stuff tends to become wrong fast :) Just focus on what is supported and by
all means say that it is a subset of functionality, just don't list what that
'other' is.

Keep that for the cover letter. Don't say what you tested in on this doc as
it'll likely become wrong very fast.

I'd skip serdev reference, that is an implementation detail we don't need in this
doc.

If this is always the case, it's a detail that belongs in your project
docs. If you are calling out the subset that Linux is supporting then make
that clear.

"The driver supports the signed 32-bit little endian sample format."

That s32 things is a little confusing as it's __le32 in Linux if it is
little endian.  Maybe don't use that and just spell out what it is.

Feels like details that belong in project docs, not here.

As a side note, if you've built your protocol well then it should be backwards
compatible. So you shouldn't care what the payload size is for messages like
this other than it is >= 20 and for now the driver only understands 20 bytes.

However, I'd just not say it here - keep it for project docs.

This is potentially interesting, but I don't think we care about the IDs, just what
device types are supported and the fact they are either 1D or 3D depending on device
type.

This basically says Linux presents it right. Not needed.

This bit is worth capturing in the Docs, but avoid RFC reference.
