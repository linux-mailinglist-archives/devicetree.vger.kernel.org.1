Well, it isn't my interpretation of CONFIG_OF_ALL_DTBS, it's actually
how arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/Makefile uses it already for the DT overlay
tests, which I already explained above.

Also, I already wrote that I'm not very happy with the way the config
option CONFIG_OF_ALL_DTBS is tied to the DT overlay tests.  I'll get
back to that below.

As I wrote above, I'm not very happy with it either.  I'll explain
that further below.

I already agreed above about CONFIG_OF_ALL_DTBS being suboptimal,
but I don't think that the need for making sure the tests are present
would be an issue.  Making sure that the tests are defined should be
simply part of the reviewing, and running those tests is actually
a good way to make revieving a bit easier.  Thus, reviewers should
actually be motivated to make sure the tests are present.

Well, if someone can't remember either of those, then I don't see how
they can remember many other rules required to write DT code. :)

FWIW, both TI and Qualcomm place the test definitions separately from
the additions to dtb-$(CONFIG_ARCH_XYZ).

I actually agree with that, just like I prefer to see .dtbo files
as additions to dtb-$(CONFIG_ARCH_XYZ).  It's all about the overlays,
so they should be both specified and echoed back.

Moreover, we currently also have additional .dtb files with applied
overlays left after the build and installed afterwards, which doesn't
make much sense to me.  To me, those additional .dtb files should be
deleted as build artefacts and not installed.

Hmm, I see.  To me, the approach taken by TI is more clear, simply
because having .dtb filenames, instead of .dtbo filenames, as part of
dtb-$(CONFIG_ARCH_XYZ) is much less readable.  When you see a .dtbo
there, it's clear that it's an overlay, and as I wrote above, it's
all about the overlays, so they should be both specified in Makefiles
and echoed back by the build system.

Good point.  This just shows how suboptimal is tying CONFIG_OF_ALL_DTBS
with the DT overlay tests.  Perhaps it would be best to remove that
association, while keeping the ability to specify .dtbo filenames in
dtb-$(CONFIG_ARCH_XYZ).  Specifying .dtb files there simply looks wrong
to me, as I already explained above.

I'd like the most to perform the above-proposed "divorcing" of the DT
overlay tests from CONFIG_OF_ALL_DTBS, so we don't have to enable any
additional options to have the overlay tests run automatically, but
to keep .dtbo filenames in dtb-$(CONFIG_ARCH_XYZ).  I think that would
bring the best of both worlds, so to speak.
