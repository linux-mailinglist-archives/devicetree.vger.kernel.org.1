I can for sure, but would you mind clarifying what needs to be done?
From my understanding two-part compatible for RTL9607C would look like
compatible = "realtek,rtl9607-wdt", "realtek,rtl8380-wdt";
But it's only gonna be relevant to OpenWrt for now.

Do i need to patch the realtek,otto-wdt.yaml file in the same way as
your patch 1 here?

Thanks in advance.
