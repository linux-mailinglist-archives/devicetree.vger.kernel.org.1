Nice data.

Oversampling might also be tied to an integration period which would
reduce as oversampling goes up, somewhat undoing the noise improvements.
So it might be worse than an averaging.  Without introducing
some dynamic motion it's going to be hard to figure this out. Maybe stick
the thing on a pendulum or if you happen to have one a record deck?
(assuming you can wire it!)
Anything to be able to repeat something that will vary the signal.
That should let you separate box car across a fixed sampling rate
from oversampling.

Is it possible it's a sampling / resampling ADC or similar so the
actual resolution is dropping? That saves some power.  Mind you
puttting that in a place called OSR1 would be odd ;)

Or as you suggest it's actually triggering burst conversion and averaging.
So datarate fixed but actual sampling time is much lower so it can
do lots of samples without the effective sampling rate changing.

Ah ok. Good detective work.  Though it would be far from the first datasheet
to confuse oversampling with straight forward filtering.

Maybe... We might have to just go for best guess and document it clearly.
