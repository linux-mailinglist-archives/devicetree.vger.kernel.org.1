Hmm... in this case, it sounds more flat where there isn't a clear channel

I have a feeling that could be problematic for existing attribute
parsers.

How about using higher numbered channel indexes instead?

out_altvoltage100_* = physical channel

out_altvoltage101_* = subcomponent
out_altvoltage102_* = subcomponent
...
