I agree with that. In my proposal, the fpga manager should be
responsible only for writing the image into the configuration memory
and allocating region devices. In-region enumeration should be handled by
the region drivers.

My worry with having one reconfiguration interface for each region is
that it does not reflect how the hardware works. To my knowledge, all
major FPGA implementations use a DMA engine (controlled by the fpga
manager) that performs the reconfiguration through a single port. So,
having one interface per region might be conceptually confusing and give
the impression that it is possible to configure regions independently in
parallel.

I think one of the issues with the current subsystem architecture is
that it coalesces two cases: full and partial images. With partial
images, it makes sense to keep the region devices and rerun the internal
enumeration. With full images, I believe it makes sense to clear and
reallocate new devices to set a new region tree.
