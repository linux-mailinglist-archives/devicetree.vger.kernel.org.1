MMU-700 and all other Arm implementations are still fully compatible 
with "arm,mmu-600-pmcg" in terms of what that means. That lets the 
driver correctly construct the "identifier" attribute, which then allows 
userspace to know what exact PMU implementation it is.

We don't maintain ever-growing lists of aliases for imp-def events in 
the kernel driver, same as we don't for CPU PMUs either. Generally, 
anyone who has reason to go near those is likely to already have the TRM 
to hand and thus have the encodings anyway, but I suppose you could add 
jevents with the proper meaningful descriptions if you really wanted to.

Thanks,
Robin.
