No I think it's:

clk	IVC	ISP	V2H doc		Desc
0xe2		vclk	reg_aclk	AXI to AHB bus bridge AXI slave clock
0xe3	reg		pclk		Input Video Control Block register access APB clock
0xe4	axi	aclk	vin_aclk	Video input data AXI bus clock
0xe5	isp	hclk	isp_sclk	ISP system clock (pixel clock)

So the IVC needs 227, 228, 229 and the bindings name them reg, axi and isp. The ISP needs 226, 228 
and 229 and the bindings name them vclk, aclk, hclk. If we want to rename the ISP's binding names 
then 228 and 229 become "axi" and "isp", and we need a sensible name for the "reg_aclk" from the 
Renesas documentation..."ahb"? or "reg"?

In my mind, given that we're treating them as separate devices, they ought to be fully (if 
worthlessly) functional independently. If the IVC gets only its reg clock then it will not stream 
until you power on the ISP separately, which does not seem right to me.>

Good question, I too would be interested to know.

I used the documentation names for the ISP, but Krzysztof later convinced me that following the 
documentation names isn't the best approach given it doesn't really tell us anything. The "reg" was 
because the docs describe that one as the register access clock.
