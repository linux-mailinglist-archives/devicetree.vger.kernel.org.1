Hi Sudeep,

We are not using clock protocol to deal with clocks individually. We are 
trying to define different perf domains for peripherals where we are 
grouping clocks/regulators/interconnect bandwidth into these perf 
domains and use OPP levels via SCMI perf protocol. This is done so as to 
avoid individual scmi calls for these resources hence avoiding any race 
conditions and minimizing the traffic between SCMI client and server to 
get better KPIs. This is being planned for sa8775p platform and any 
subsequent platforms will use the same approach. The idea of using perf 
protocol for peripherals is new and I Qualcomm is first one trying to 
use that. Therefore existing peripheral drivers will require a way to 
distinguish between the two different configurations. Hope this provides 
little more context and insight.

Thanks
