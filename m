It's a fair question from sashiko as seems a stop command or reset is
needed to break out of that mode and let other commands function.

There is the option of a soft reset which might make sense to implement
in probe() but it's an odd one as it's a general call (so may affect
other devices on the same bus).

Given we can never know what silly mode some other software has left
the device in, we'd normally reset (but here probably can't due
to the reset addressing all devices on the bus), we can however
just issue a stop command in probe()  I think I'd prefer that to
shutdown()  Note I couldn't find a statement that says stop can
be issued when not running continuous mode.  So test that and see.
Hopefully it's a no-op!

This is about fallback compatibles - it is absolutely expected to
happen in the future (assuming this company doesn't feel the need
to keep inventing new control schemes for every device released!)
dev_info() is fine.

Agree on this one.

For IIO drivers, we normally consider power management a 'feature'
that can be added later. Sure kooky things can happen if it's not
there and the 'feature' is used. That might mean you have to rebind
the driver.  If a platform cuts the power to a device with a driver
that doesn't know it can happen, then it is broken at a higher level.
