...and this are important pieces of information. Can you add a summary
to v7 commit message explaining on the chosen approach?

Also would be nice to have something from this.

So, I think for v7 we need transform this discussion to a summary that covers
all aspects:

- why MFD box can't be applied here
- why regmaps are independent
- how does it look with data and configuration paths
- the device is unique and we do not expect more to come (or very little chances)
- et cetera (or what I forgot to mention)
