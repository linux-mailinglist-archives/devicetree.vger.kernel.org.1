No, I disagree here, and this is the core of the issue IMO. Boot data
and runtime data are tied to UEFI boot. A non-UEFI OS must either keep
these regions reserved and not use them at all, or disregard the
reservation and use them as ordinary memory.

What I don't want is a frankenstein construction where UEFI boot is
avoided for religious reasons, but the regions in question are still
parsed/accessed/etc to reimplement things like SMBIOS etc in a way
that violates the specification.

The OS should not have to care about this at all. The reservations are
intended for firmware stages, not the OS. The OS will either find
these reservations in the UEFI memory map, or it should not care about
them at all.

I was not part of any agreement that 2 separate DTs are unnecessary,
and I think this discussion proves that exposing firmware
implementation details to the OS via a unified DT can be problematic.
