Sounds to me like fixing multi-CS for SPI (flash mem) to make sure it
works for that case as well is a good idea. Another approach can be to
reconsider both existing ones (pros & cons) and come up with the better
idea and replace them with that.

But fixing an one hack by another hack seems to me not the best strategy.

Good catch!

Taking what I wrote in the above section, maybe it's the best to remove it
and we go to understand what to do with the spi_new_ancillary_device?

At least that's common for I²C EEPROMs.
