There were quite some discussions a while ago, I remember Maxime being
involved back then. But I am too lazy to dig those out now, maybe I
find some pointers later.

There are arguments for and against this, and it's not crystal clear.
Some platforms (Rockchip?) decided to allow them, but we said no.
One key argument was that the kernel never promised any kind of
consistent numbering, whether it's /dev/mmcblk0 or /dev/mmcblk1 is
entirely up to the kernel to decide. And we don't have this connection
for other devices, for instance USB disks. The plug and play nature of
those makes it obvious that we cannot guarantee this anyway, and I have
seen systems where a USB stick at boot became /dev/sda, and the first
SATA disk was enumerated as /dev/sdb.
Which means the reliance on numbering if ill-fated, and we need (and
have!) better and more sustainable methods anyway, so why not use them
everywhere? The mainline kernel tends to push against sketchy solutions
to very particular problems, because they often come back and bite us
later, and then nobody of the original people are around anymore to fix
them.

I see your point of "but it's such an easy solution", and there is an
argument that the hardware dictates some kind of ordering (SDC0 vs.
SDC3), but I don't think it outweighs the argument above, and lures
people into relying on things that the kernel doesn't want to promise.

That's a shame, and I really wish Yocto people wouldn't just take
patches that have not been reviewed or even NAK'ed upstream. Those
meta layers becoming a pool of unreviewed or rejected patches is
really a bad side effect of Yocto making it easy to apply patches.

Another point: this is fixing the problem for just this particular
board. What about the other V3s boards, and in extension the other
Allwinner boards? I count 240 DTs for 32-bit boards alone in the repo,
so a more generic solutions sounds much more reasonable than applying
band-aid to one board.

Cheers,
Andre
