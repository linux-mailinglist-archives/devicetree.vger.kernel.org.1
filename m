Hm. I kind of agree. The constant, 'common for all sensors' 
-coefficients should probably be hard-coded as sensor defaults. The 
BH1730 data-sheet seems to be describing a set of coefficients. I 
suppose that's what comes from the packaging(?)

And just to contradict myself...

I can imagine two reasons to alter these coefficients:

1.(st) being what Jonathan described. Eg. having something like a lens 
or a glass or whatever, on top of the sensor. That can alter the light 
entering the sensor, and require change to the coefficients. And indeed, 
it would make sense to only describe this in the DT, because the sensor 
is already described. That'd mean the DT should only contain the 
'coefficient delta' caused by <add the cause here>.

2. In theory, there could also be another reason. I bet the sensors are 
all 'individuals' to some extent. So, for something requiring very high 
accuracy, there could be some kind of calibration process at device 
manufacturing. This might produce more accurate, device specific 
coefficients. Considering this use-case, I am not 100% convinced it's 
"wrong" to be able to give the device-specific coefficients from the DT. 
(Because, here the coefficients really are a property of the device 
itself and aren't added by some external part).

And, if we consider allowing describing (the more accurate) device 
coefficients from the DT (for case 2), then it would just be simpler to 
always provide the "full coefficients" from the DT, no matter if they 
are caused by the device packaging or added lens/glass/XXX. And, as the 
infamous, and not even existing rohm,dh2228fv device shows, people do 
use the simplest solutions even when it isn't really right ;)

So, I am tempted to suggest we just go with the flow, and allow 
describing the coefficients from the DT, without separating the source, 
(lens/glass/device-packaging) which is what this patch does. (If I read 
it right.) However, I would like to see a property which can be re-used 
by other devices as this seems to be pretty common. Yeah, it's probably 
not _right_, but it feels practical.

Well, this is just my 0.5 cents, and even I may change my opinion on 
this though :)

Yours,
	-- Matti
