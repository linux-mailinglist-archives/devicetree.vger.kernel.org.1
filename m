That wasn't my point. My point was, make it possible to compile the PRG 
parts out if they aren't needed (and with them, SCU support). If I build 
the kernel for iMX95, I don't need iMX8Q support in, so I can turn MX8Q 
support off alongside the SCU parts. The clean way to do that is to keep 
the SCU-dependent parts in dedicated file(s), which may or may not be 
compiled in. For generic kernel builds, they should be compiled in and 
decide at runtime, whether or not they should be used of course.

You could have one regmap for MX8Q and one regmap for MX95. For the 
register IO in the driver which uses regmap, either regmap is still only 
a generic regmap, no matter what the hardware accessor in that regmap 
are. Therefore most of the code can be generic (use generic regmap) and 
only the probe code decides which regmap (MX8Q SCU regmap or MX95 
regmap) is going to be used by the driver.

You could have one regmap definition for MX8Q/SCU and one for MX95, and 
at probe time, select which of those is going to be used. That could 
work I think ?

Can we have separate atomic_enable() callback for MX8Q and MX95 for 
example ?

I think the prefetch code can be contained in a single file and called 
only if the SoC is MX8Q, that shouldn't be difficult to do ?
