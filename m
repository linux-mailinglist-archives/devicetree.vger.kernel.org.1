The common reserved-memory bindings have recently been copied from the
kernel tree into dtschema. The preference is to host common, stable
bindings in dtschema. As reserved-memory is documented in the DT Spec,
it meets the criteria.

The v2023.09 version of dtschema is what contains the reserved-memory
schemas we depend on, so bump the minimum version to that. Otherwise,
references to these schemas will generate errors.

-description: >
-  Reserved memory is specified as a node under the /reserved-memory node. The
-  operating system shall exclude reserved memory from normal usage one can
-  create child nodes describing particular reserved (excluded from normal use)
-  memory regions. Such memory regions are usually designed for the special
-  usage by various device drivers.
-
-  Each child of the reserved-memory node specifies one or more regions
-  of reserved memory. Each child node may either use a 'reg' property to
-  specify a specific range of reserved memory, or a 'size' property with
-  optional constraints to request a dynamically allocated block of
-  memory.
-
-  Following the generic-names recommended practice, node names should
-  reflect the purpose of the node (ie. "framebuffer" or "dma-pool").
-  Unit address (@<address>) should be appended to the name if the node
-  is a static allocation.

-    description: >
-      A list of phandle and specifier pairs that describe static IO virtual
-      address space mappings and carveouts associated with a given reserved
-      memory region. The phandle in the first cell refers to the device for
-      which the mapping or carveout is to be created.
-
-      The specifier consists of an address/size pair and denotes the IO
-      virtual address range of the region for the given device. The exact
-      format depends on the values of the "#address-cells" and "#size-cells"
-      properties of the device referenced via the phandle.
-
-      When used in combination with a "reg" property, an IOVA mapping is to
-      be established for this memory region. One example where this can be
-      useful is to create an identity mapping for physical memory that the
-      firmware has configured some hardware to access (such as a bootsplash
-      framebuffer).
-
-      If no "reg" property is specified, the "iommu-addresses" property
-      defines carveout regions in the IOVA space for the given device. This
-      can be useful if a certain memory region should not be mapped through
-      the IOMMU.

-    type: boolean
-    description: >
-      Indicates the operating system must not create a virtual mapping
-      of the region as part of its standard mapping of system memory,

-      than under the control of the device driver using the region.
-
-  reusable:
-    type: boolean
-    description: >
-      The operating system can use the memory in this region with the
-      limitation that the device driver(s) owning the region need to be
-      able to reclaim it back. Typically that means that the operating
-      system can use that region to store volatile or cached data that
-      can be otherwise regenerated or migrated elsewhere.

-          This indicates a region of memory meant to be used as a pool
-          of restricted DMA buffers for a set of devices. The memory
-          region would be the only region accessible to those devices.
-          When using this, the no-map and reusable properties must not
-          be set, so the operating system can create a virtual mapping
-          that will be used for synchronization. The main purpose for
-          restricted DMA is to mitigate the lack of DMA access control
-          on systems without an IOMMU, which could result in the DMA
-          accessing the system memory at unexpected times and/or
-          unexpected addresses, possibly leading to data leakage or
-          corruption. The feature on its own provides a basic level of
-          protection against the DMA overwriting buffer contents at
-          unexpected times. However, to protect against general data
-          leakage and system memory corruption, the system needs to
-          provide way to lock down the memory access, e.g., MPU. Note
-          that since coherent allocation needs remapping, one must set
-          up another device coherent pool by shared-dma-pool and use
-          dma_alloc_from_dev_coherent instead for atomic coherent
-          allocation.
