According to the application note:

It can be helpful for an application to be able to differentiate between li=
ght
sources and react accordingly. The additional IR channel offers the
possibilities to do a light source differentiation based on the IR content
measured with the IR channel. A ratio between the IR and ALS channel can
be calculated to determine the amount of IR light within the light source=
=E2=80=99s
spectrum. This easily allows, for example halogen bulb to be kept apart fro=
m
an LED light.

Probably not the most useful IR channel out there, but there's still
something you could do with it :D

I will add a devm action for the events to decrement the usage count if
events are enabled i.e. the usage count was incremented.
