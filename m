in document:

fsl,imx50-ssi
fsl,imx53-ssi
fsl,imx25-ssi
fsl,imx27-ssi
fsl,imx6q-ssi
fsl,imx6sl-ssi
fsl,imx6sx-ssi

Add below fsl,mode strings which were not listed.

i2s-slave
i2s-master
lj-slave
lj-master
rj-slave
rj-master

Add 'ac97-gpios' property which were not listed.
Then dtbs_check can pass.

And remove the 'codec' description which should be
in the 'codec' binding doc.

Signed-off-by: Shengjiu Wang <shengjiu.wang@nxp.com>

changes in v2:
- change fallback string to const.
- add dai-common.yaml
- add ac97-gpios property

-Freescale Synchronous Serial Interface
-
-The SSI is a serial device that communicates with audio codecs.  It can
-be programmed in AC97, I2S, left-justified, or right-justified modes.
-
-Required properties:
-- compatible:       Compatible list, should contain one of the following
-                    compatibles:
-                      fsl,mpc8610-ssi
-                      fsl,imx51-ssi
-                      fsl,imx35-ssi
-                      fsl,imx21-ssi
-- cell-index:       The SSI, <0> = SSI1, <1> = SSI2, and so on.
-- reg:              Offset and length of the register set for the device.
-- interrupts:       <a b> where a is the interrupt number and b is a
-                    field that represents an encoding of the sense and
-                    level information for the interrupt.  This should be
-                    encoded based on the information in section 2)
-                    depending on the type of interrupt controller you
-                    have.
-- fsl,fifo-depth:   The number of elements in the transmit and receive FIFOs.
-                    This number is the maximum allowed value for SFCSR[TFWM0].
- - clocks:          "ipg" - Required clock for the SSI unit
-                    "baud" - Required clock for SSI master mode. Otherwise this
-		      clock is not used
-
-Required are also ac97 link bindings if ac97 is used. See
-Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/soc-ac97link.txt for the necessary
-bindings.
-
-Optional properties:
-- codec-handle:     Phandle to a 'codec' node that defines an audio
-                    codec connected to this SSI.  This node is typically
-                    a child of an I2C or other control node.
-- fsl,fiq-stream-filter: Bool property. Disabled DMA and use FIQ instead to
-		    filter the codec stream. This is necessary for some boards
-		    where an incompatible codec is connected to this SSI, e.g.
-		    on pca100 and pcm043.
-- dmas:		    Generic dma devicetree binding as described in
-		    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt.
-- dma-names:	    Two dmas have to be defined, "tx" and "rx", if fsl,imx-fiq
-		    is not defined.
-- fsl,mode:         The operating mode for the AC97 interface only.
-                    "ac97-slave" - AC97 mode, SSI is clock slave
-                    "ac97-master" - AC97 mode, SSI is clock master
-- fsl,ssi-asynchronous:
-                    If specified, the SSI is to be programmed in asynchronous
-                    mode.  In this mode, pins SRCK, STCK, SRFS, and STFS must
-                    all be connected to valid signals.  In synchronous mode,
-                    SRCK and SRFS are ignored.  Asynchronous mode allows
-                    playback and capture to use different sample sizes and
-                    sample rates.  Some drivers may require that SRCK and STCK
-                    be connected together, and SRFS and STFS be connected
-                    together.  This would still allow different sample sizes,
-                    but not different sample rates.
-- fsl,playback-dma: Phandle to a node for the DMA channel to use for
-                    playback of audio.  This is typically dictated by SOC
-                    design.  See the notes below.
-                    Only used on Power Architecture.
-- fsl,capture-dma:  Phandle to a node for the DMA channel to use for
-                    capture (recording) of audio.  This is typically dictated
-                    by SOC design.  See the notes below.
-                    Only used on Power Architecture.
-
-Child 'codec' node required properties:
-- compatible:       Compatible list, contains the name of the codec
-
-Child 'codec' node optional properties:
-- clock-frequency:  The frequency of the input clock, which typically comes
-                    from an on-board dedicated oscillator.
-
-Notes on fsl,playback-dma and fsl,capture-dma:
-
-On SOCs that have an SSI, specific DMA channels are hard-wired for playback
-and capture.  On the MPC8610, for example, SSI1 must use DMA channel 0 for
-playback and DMA channel 1 for capture.  SSI2 must use DMA channel 2 for
-playback and DMA channel 3 for capture.  The developer can choose which
-DMA controller to use, but the channels themselves are hard-wired.  The
-purpose of these two properties is to represent this hardware design.
-
-The device tree nodes for the DMA channels that are referenced by
-"fsl,playback-dma" and "fsl,capture-dma" must be marked as compatible with
-"fsl,ssi-dma-channel".  The SOC-specific compatible string (e.g.
-"fsl,mpc8610-dma-channel") can remain.  If these nodes are left as
-"fsl,elo-dma-channel" or "fsl,eloplus-dma-channel", then the generic Elo DMA
-drivers (fsldma) will attempt to use them, and it will conflict with the
-sound drivers.
