Maybe the glitch can occur if we're changing period and duty exactly during
the strobe, unless the register writing is somehow in sync with the PWM clock.
Disabling the channel immediately stops any execution and the line goes suddenly
low (if polarity is normal, otherwise stays high). See also next.

Citing the datasheet:

"To prevent mis-sampling of multi-bit bus signals in the PWM clock domain,
this bit (SET_UPDATE) should be used to trigger a settings update. This
ensures that all PWM channel settings update on the same PWM clock cycle."

From my testing though, channels can be started in sync only if they have the
same period. I'll add a comment for all this, and other edge cases.

The output stops immediately without waiting for the current period to finish.

The disable isn't delayed as explained above. Setting just the new period/duty
(which do not depend on the sync bit) correctly waits for the end of the current
period without noticeable glitches (tested with a scope).

Exactly. So whatever the user request I have to subtract one from the value
to be written to the RANGE register.

Ah right! It's working fine and I've got 100% duty. So at hw register level
the duty can be greater that the period.

No need, it's working indeed.

Minimum tick confirmed to be 1.

Hmmm not sure I've understood your point: is it a requirement that the driver
must be unbindable? In this case I should avoid registering the syscon. Or
should I just provide a .remove callback in case there will be a way to
unregister the syscon (even if this callback will not be called as of now)?

Many thanks,
Andrea
