Yes, I do like the variant of _not_ limiting these builds to
CONFIG_OF_ALL_DTBS. From reading up on it, it's supposed to build all
dtbs - even from non-selected architectures?

So on a rockchip-only-build I'd still want to build the dtb+dtbo
combination nevertheless.

zynq, renesas, qcom and more are doing this like Quentin proposed, where
only ti is not.
