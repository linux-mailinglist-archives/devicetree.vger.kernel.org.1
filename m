2 thoughts here:
1) I actually tried to run it with ollama on my personal framework 13. Addin=
g nominal support is trivial,
but the whole thing is not really useful: I can get maybe few hundreds token=
s per second using
a quantified model with reduced quality; an average sashiko review is consum=
ing 3.5 millions tokens
(with Gemini 3.1 pro, it=E2=80=99s also model-dependent).
I=E2=80=99m personally all in on having the entire thing as open as possible=
 and I believe Sashiko is what=20
is realistically the best at this moment - a fully open-source harness and s=
et of prompts which=20
can work with a variety of models.
I=E2=80=99m happy to merge a support for any LLM model which can produce dec=
ent review results.

2) Due to probabilistic nature of LLMs, nothing is reproducible in a strict s=
ense of the word.
Even with exactly the same model/harness/prompts you=E2=80=99ll get differen=
t results every time you run it.
It=E2=80=99s unfortunate, but it is what it is at the moment.
