Well, not in the sense of pick one of 3 options. It's another option
in how to fix the kernel. I think we should fix any .dts files we can
in addition to fixing the kernel.

Yes. It's not novel though. The powerpc code is littered with such
things. Some of them due to the commit in question here. Look at
commits from me in arch/powerpc.

I started some common infrastructure to apply fixups, but the case in
particular that needed it ended up not needing it. So it's something I
have on a branch somewhere. Also it worked on the unflattened tree as
not all things need to be fixed up early.
