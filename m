It is not necessary to ship an updated DTB.
The bootloader stack can just change the "status" properties of devices
nodes that are be taken away from Linux from "okay" to "reserved":

Devicetree Specification, Release v0.4, Table 2.4: Values for statu
property states:

    Value: "reserved"
    Description:
        Indicates that the device is operational, but should not be
        used. Typically this is used for devices that are controlled
        by another software component, such as platform firmware.

When all SCMI IDs change, too, much more work needs to be done.

The remap driver could also help here: it could scan for device nodes
that are marked "reserved", remove SCMI IDs used in these nodes from
its internal tables, and adjust all later (higher) IDs.

E.g. the existing drivers/clk/renesas/renesas-cpg-mssr.c already handles
(ignores) clocks used by reserved nodes.

As long as the IDs in arch/arm64/boot/dts/arm/juno-scmi.dtsi
match the actual SCMI implementation, that works...

As long as the ID space becomes stable.
