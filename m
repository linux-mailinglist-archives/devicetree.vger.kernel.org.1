I can confirm that reverting that commit makes the issue disappear. So
we're dealing with an interrupt storm that occurs when all three of the
following conditions are true:

- cpu-pd-wait is enabled
- EEE is enabled
- the peer also supports EEE

Furthermore, I tried counting bits from all the interrupt status
registers I could find. The count of MTL_INTERRUPT_STATUS Q0IS to Q4IS
bits is very high, and so are the DMA_CH0_STATUS TBU and ETI bits.

The debix board's DT doesn't specify a multi-queue setup, so only
channel 0 gets processed in stmmac_dma_interrupt(). I thought that could
explain why Q1IS to Q4IS stay set (but not why Q0IS also has a high
count, or why Q1IS to Q4IS are set in the first place), and enabled
multi-queue support in DT by copying the imx8mp-evk configuration. I
then see lots of non-zero DMA_CH1_STATUS, DMA_CH2_STATUS and
DMA_CH4_STATUS values (but DMA_CH3_STATUS stays 0 all the time), but
sadly this doesn't fix the interrupt storm.

I don't know how much sense all this makes, and I'm sorry if the above
information is unclear, incomplete or completely wrong, my experience
with the DWMAC is very limited.

I don't think I can debug this further and figure out the root cause
unassisted in a reasonable amount of time, so I'd like to merge
disabling EEE as a workaround for the time being, unless someone has any
idea of what I could test next. I'll submit a v2 of this patch with an
updated commit message.
