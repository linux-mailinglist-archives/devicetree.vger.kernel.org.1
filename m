I don't believe anything we have at the moment is what you're looking
for.

Effectively yes, I think.

The

Why don't you know this? I'd expect there to be 1:1 mapping of gpios to
clocks, with an equal number of input and output clocks, since all
you're doing is detecting if the clocks are ready to go?
