If an overlay uses "reg", then you have to care what the cell sizes are. 
Sure, I2C is fairly hard to get wrong. But what about an overlay with 
MMIO devices where the sizes could be any combination of 1 or 2 cells.

I think the current overlay format is crap and that's largely due to 
inheriting FDT format limitations. Primarily, I'm talking about 
the __fixups__ nodes. That exists because there's no type and size 
information stored within the FDT format. We of course would like type 
information for other reasons. We could kill off #foo-cells for example.

I'd really like to us rev the FDT format to add new tags to store type 
information. Frank captured some discussion on this a while back on 
elinux.org. The problem is 'new FDT format' becomes a shopping list, so 
I don't hold out much hope. It's been discussed for at least 10 years 
now. If we at least did enough now to allow and ignore unknown FDT tags, 
then we could add new tags in the future with little pain or 
compatibility problems.

I think a connector would largely avoid this particular problem. Take 
I2C for example, we'd just define an I2C bus node for each I2C bus 
under the connector node and then map that bus into a parent bus. So 
you're going to have the properties to be able to parse things anyways.
