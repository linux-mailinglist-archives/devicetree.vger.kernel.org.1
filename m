I map using nexus nodes only resources (gpio, pwm, ...) connected to
the connector. What do you mean by all possible enumerated items in DT?

This node ('devices') is here to offer an entry point to fixed-regulators,
fixed-clocks, ... Those device are soldered on the addon board and are not
connected to any busses (i2c, spi, ...). They need to be described and this
node allows to describe them. It was proposed in our connector binding:
   https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240813151901.GA953664-robh@kernel.org/

This node indeed, is taken into account by the connector driver with a call
to of_platform_default_populate().

Where do you put your fixed-clock and fixed-regulator soldered on your addon
board in your DT description (overlay) proposal ?

A connector needs a driver. This point has been confirmed by Rob Herring:
  https://lore.kernel.org/all/CAL_JsqKg0NpDi1Zf1T+f2rYw5UuVfK7+kjWj1_edFWH8EStjXw@mail.gmail.com/

Nexus node are not handled by the connector driver.
The related translation is handled by the core OF with
of_parse_phandle_with_args_map():
  https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.14-rc6/source/drivers/of/base.c#L1441

Nexus node can be used without drivers. They are just a translation described
in the DT. The connector driver itself has nothing to do to have nexus node
translation working.

No, why do you need to disable SPI controller if nothing is connected to the
SPI busses. Again this bus is wired to the connector and once an addon board
is connected, a device can be connected to the bus.

For a SPI controller, set in low power (suspend/resume) when nothing is
connected and so the bus is not used, I understand.
Set to 'disabled' status seems to me incorrect.

The meaning of 'disabled' status in my understanding is the device is not used.
As the related bus connected to the connector and available for any addon board,
the device is "used".

Can you clarify this point?

Yes and it can be easily extended to SPI and other busses.
I don't see any blocking point with this point.

This 'i2c-parent' handling is part of 'i2c bus extension' series, I sent.
SPI and other can be updated to follow the exact same strategy.

In my use-case, this overlay is applied by the connector driver using
of_overlay_fdt_apply(). The target node (the connector of_node) is passed 
as parameter to the function.

Exactly, in our case, we have an EEPROM soldered on all kind of addon-board
we support for our vendor specific connector.

We load a first overlay describing needed hardware to access this EEPROM.
All supported addon-board used the same EEPROM and need the same hardware
to access it.

Thanks to this EEPROM, we can identify the addon board and so apply a
second overlay to describe the specific hardware available on the addon
board we identified.

A power-supply from the base board is wired to the connector ?
Right:

--- Base DT ---
	/* The regulator used or can also be a child node of the PMIC */
	regulator_wired_to_addon: regulator_3v3 {
		compatible = "xxxx"
		regulator-min-microvolt = <330000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <330000>;
        }

        addon_connector0: addon-connector0 {
		...
		export-symbols {
			/*
			 * The 'addon_connector' symbol can be used from the
			 * overlay to reference this connector
			 */
			addon_connector = <&addon_connector0>;
			
			/*
			 * The 3v3 power supply available at the connector */
			 */
			addon_connector_pwr_3v3: <&regulator_wired_to_addon>;

		};


The addon board has a device that use this 3v3 provided at the connector

--- Overlay ---

	fragment@0 {
		target-path = "";

		__overlay__ {
			...
			i2c-addon {
				/*
				 * An I2C device that is powered by the 3v3
				 * available at the connector
				 */
				foo@10 {
					compatible = "bar,foo";
					reg = <0x10>;
					...
					vcc-supply = <&addon_connector_pwr_3v3>;
				};
			};
		};
	};

I don't see anything incorrect or blocking in that description.
involving export-symbols.

Chip select are described at SPI controller node -> described in the base dts.

The SPI lines wired to the connector should be described as a "SPI bus
extension". This extension described at SPI controller node similar to
"I2C bus extension".
Note: For I2C bus extension sent upstream, the extension is also described
      at the I2C controller node) see
        https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250205173918.600037-1-herve.codina@bootlin.com/

For SPI, a description for translating SPI chip selects from the controller
point of view to the connector can be doable easily.
Something to tell: "The chip-select number 5 of this controller is wired to
the chip-select number 0 defined by the pin 'SPI CS' at the connector"

And then, devices added in the SPI extension at the connector will used this
chip-select.


In other words, something like the following:

--- base board ---
	spi0: spi@1000 {
		comptible = "xxxxx":
		reg = 0x1000;

		spi-bus-extension@0 {
			cs-map = <5 0>	/* For this extension, CS number 5
					 * from the controller point of view
					 * becomes CS number 0 from the addon
					 * board point of view
					 */
          		spi-bus = <&spi_addon>;
		};
	};

	addon_connector0: addon-connector0 {
		...
		/*
		 * This is the SPI bus wired at the connector. It is
		 * handled by the spi@1000 controller available in the SoC.
		 * The overlay will add devices in this node. Those
		 * devices are devices available on the addon-board and
		 * connected to this SPI bus
		 */
		spi-addon {
			spi-parent = <&spi0>;
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
		};
	};


--- Overlay ---

	fragment@0 {
		target-path = "";

		__overlay__ {
			...
			spi-addon {
				/*
				 * An SPI device in the addon board using
				 * at the CS number 0 of the connector
				 */
				flash@0 {
					compatible = "jedec,spi-nor";
					reg = <0>;
					spi-max-frequency = <40000000>;
				};
			};
		};
	};

Andrew, with your proposal how can you decouple the Chip Select?
I didn't see anything about SPI in your "Add generic Overlay for Grove
Sunlight Sensor" series you pointed out.
Maybe I missed it.

Do you have any other idea to do that?
