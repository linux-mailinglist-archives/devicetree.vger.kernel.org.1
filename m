I notice you dropped the topology information from all patches in the
series, not only the 2k0500 patch that only has one CPU. I didn't see a
response to my comments the kernel being able to assemble the topology
based on the second level caches using the generic topology code for the
systems that have more than one cpu. With the cpu-map information
dropped, do the multi-cpu systems have their topologies assembled
correctly by the kernel?
You mentioned that there is an instruction that allows you to get
information about i and d caches etc, so adding them to the DT is not
required, but does it also cover the next level caches?
The program that I am familiar with for displaying this information
is hwloc: https://github.com/open-mpi/hwloc

Cheers,
Conor.
