I understand what you are saying now about the gem and emcas being flipped.

If we are set to have an external and internal clock dt property than I
think we should just keep those if statements inside the !USRIO_DISABLED
code block just to keep it more organized and clean and keeping the
current HAS_CLKEN if statement be the fallback default case to set the
register bit value. Some thing like this:

if (!(bp->caps & MACB_CAPS_USRIO_DISABLED)) {
		if (property_present(refclk-source)) {
			if (property_read_string == "external")
				val |= true;
			else
				val |= false;
		}
		else if (bp->caps & MACB_CAPS_USRIO_HAS_CLKEN)
			val |= bp->usrio->refclk;

		macb_or_gem_writel(bp, USRIO, val);
}

Would this be a good middle ground?
