My feeling on this (and I don't have much time to consider it tonight)
is that this isn't going to get a quick answer.

This answer is based on my authorship of various device trees, and is
solely my own opinion, and in no way represents any position by my
employer.

While the DT files are dual-licensed, the license that applies to the
copy in the kernel is GPL v2, because the kernel as a whole is GPL v2
licensed. The dual-licensing of the DT files is to permit them to be
taken from the kernel and used in e.g. boot loaders etc.

However, as the license that applies to the kernel copy is GPL v2, and
GPL v2 requires distribution in source code form, or an offer valid
for two years of the corresponding source code etc (check the GPL v2
for the exact terms) it could be inappropriate for the kernel tree
to distribute binary DT blobs without their corresponding source.

It seems to me that this is a problem for lawyers, and you're probably
not going to get a quick answer on it.

So, I'd suggest patience, and don't expect this topic to move quickly.
