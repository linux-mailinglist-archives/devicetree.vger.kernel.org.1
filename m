I would like to see a way to disable 2 space indentation warnings. It's 
not something I think we should 'fix' treewide, so we can't have 
warnings for all of them. Perhaps just check for consistent indentation.

I would guess this is more a .dts issue as examples are mostly a single 
node.

I think we already check this except for spaces followed by tabs. We 
might be able to add that to yamllint.

This could be a schema. I actually have a WIP schema that I never 
finished. The check I had added was banning 'status' in examples.

One reason the binding checks are so slow is due to python start-up 
times. Part of the start-up time is module imports and IIRC ruamel.yaml 
is pretty slow. That's why dt-doc-validate is not called for each 
individual binding file for example and we shard it with xargs which you 
followed. But really, make wants to do things a file at a time.

We already parse the example once with dt-extract-example, so perhaps 
the best approach would be to run these checks at that point.

'make dt_binding_check' must be warning free (with the exception of 
using dtschema main (unreleased) branch. So this will need to be 
reworked to maintain that to be mergeable.

I think this would be useful for .dts files too, so it would be good if 
the extract example part and checks could be separated. We already have 
code to extract examples, but then you lose some things like what the 
indentation should be. And implementing as a diff or automatic fix mode 
would be harder.
