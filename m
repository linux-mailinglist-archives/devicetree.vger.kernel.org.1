So these 6 properties defines the soc itself? And the rules for how a
bootloader matches against these 6 properties is defined elsewhere?

What about "PCB" name and version?

How about the case where my product has 5 different components that
might come from a second source?

Are you proposing that we allow adding arbitrary properties matching
some pattern in the top-level node to facilitate matching? Presumably
defined in some combination of vendor bindings?

We have qcom,msm-id; qcom,board-id; qcom,pmic-id; these have met the
needs of some, but generally it lacks multiple axis.

We do have functionality that relates to the generic soc name,
(qcom,sdm845 in your example above). Extracting it into something else
would imply that we need to check against soc-family-compatible?

But when it comes to bootloaders picking the appropriate compatible,
I've seen plenty of cases where basing it on compatible would be nasty.

E.g. how do you write your string matching routine such that it allows
all the different axis, where some are optional, some allows fallback to
previous minor revisions of the chip etc.
